A common\\nbelief is their attention-based token mixer module contributes most to their\\ncompetence. However, recent works show the attention-based module in\\ntransformers can be replaced by spatial MLPs and the resulted models still\\nperform quite well. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that the general\\narchitecture of the transformers, instead of the specific token mixer module,\\nis more essential to the model's performance. To verify this, we deliberately\\nreplace the attention module in transformers with an embarrassingly simple\\nspatial pooling operator to conduct only the most basic token mixing.\\nSurprisingly, we observe that the derived model, termed as PoolFormer, achieves\\ncompetitive performance on multiple computer vision tasks. For example, on\\nImageNet-1K, PoolFormer achieves 82.1% top-1 accuracy, surpassing well-tuned\\nvision transformer/MLP-like baselines DeiT-B/ResMLP-B24 by 0.3%/1.1% accuracy\\nwith 35%/52% fewer parameters and 48%/60% fewer MACs. The effectiveness of\\nPoolFormer verifies our hypothesis and urges us to initiate the concept of\\n\"MetaFormer\", a general architecture abstracted from transformers without\\nspecifying the token mixer. Based on the extensive experiments, we argue that\\nMetaFormer is the key player in achieving superior results for recent\\ntransformer and MLP-like models on vision tasks. This work calls for more\\nfuture research dedicated to improving MetaFormer instead of focusing on the\\ntoken mixer modules. Additionally, our proposed PoolFormer could serve as a\\nstarting baseline for future MetaFormer architecture design. Code is available\\nat https://github.com/sail-sg/poolformer   \n",

Advances in the design of reliable codes have been\\ndriven by coding theory and have been sporadic. Recently, it is shown that\\nchannel codes that are comparable to modern codes can be learned solely via\\ndeep learning. In particular, Turbo Autoencoder (TURBOAE), introduced by Jiang\\net al., is shown to achieve the reliability of Turbo codes for Additive White\\nGaussian Noise channels. In this paper, we focus on applying the idea of\\nTURBOAE to various practical channels, such as fading channels and chirp noise\\nchannels. We introduce TURBOAE-TI, a novel neural architecture that combines\\nTURBOAE with a trainable interleaver design. We develop a carefully-designed\\ntraining procedure and a novel interleaver penalty function that are crucial in\\nlearning the interleaver and TURBOAE jointly. We demonstrate that TURBOAE-TI\\noutperforms TURBOAE and LTE Turbo codes for several channels of interest. We\\nalso provide interpretation analysis to better understand TURBOAE-TI.   \n",
              "2  Point defects are responsible for a wide range of optoelectronic properties\\nin materials, making it crucial to engineer their concentrations for novel\\nmaterials design. However, considering the plethora of defects in co-doped\\nsemiconducting and dielectric materials and the dependence of defect formation\\nenergies on heat treatment parameters, process design based on an experimental\\ntrial and error approach is not an efficient strategy. This makes it necessary\\nto explore computational pathways for predicting defect equilibria during heat\\ntreatments. The accumulated experimental knowledge on defect transformations in\\ndiamond is unparalleled. Therefore, diamond is an excellent material for\\nbenchmarking computational approaches. By considering nitrogen, hydrogen, and\\nsilicon doped diamond as a model system, we have investigated the pressure\\ndependence of defect formation energies and calculated the defect equilibria\\nduring heat treatment of diamond through ab-initio calculations. We have\\nplotted monolithic-Kr\\\"oger-Vink diagrams for various defects, representing\\ndefect concentrations based on process parameters, such as temperature and\\npartial pressure of gases used during heat treatments of diamond. The method\\ndemonstrated predicts the majority of experimental data, such as nitrogen\\naggregation path leading towards the formation of the B center, annealing of\\nthe B, H3, N3, and NVHx centers at ultra high temperatures, the thermal\\nstability of the SiV center, and temperature dependence of NV concentration. We\\ndemonstrate the possibility of designing heat treatments for a wide range of\\nsemiconducting and dielectric materials by using a relatively inexpensive yet\\nrobust first principles approach, significantly accelerating defect engineering\\nand high-throughput novel materials design.   \n",

              "      <td>Transformers have shown great potential in computer vision tasks. A common\\nbelief is their attention-based token mixer module contributes most to their\\ncompetence. However, recent works show the attention-based module in\\ntransformers can be replaced by spatial MLPs and the resulted models still\\nperform quite well. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that the general\\narchitecture of the transformers, instead of the specific token mixer module,\\nis more essential to the model's performance. To verify this, we deliberately\\nreplace the attention module in transformers with an embarrassingly simple\\nspatial pooling operator to conduct only the most basic token mixing.\\nSurprisingly, we observe that the derived model, termed as PoolFormer, achieves\\ncompetitive performance on multiple computer vision tasks. For example, on\\nImageNet-1K, PoolFormer achieves 82.1% top-1 accuracy, surpassing well-tuned\\nvision transformer/MLP-like baselines DeiT-B/ResMLP-B24 by 0.3%/1.1% accuracy\\nwith 35%/52% fewer parameters and 48%/60% fewer MACs. The effectiveness of\\nPoolFormer verifies our hypothesis and urges us to initiate the concept of\\n\"MetaFormer\", a general architecture abstracted from transformers without\\nspecifying the token mixer. Based on the extensive experiments, we argue that\\nMetaFormer is the key player in achieving superior results for recent\\ntransformer and MLP-like models on vision tasks. This work calls for more\\nfuture research dedicated to improving MetaFormer instead of focusing on the\\ntoken mixer modules. Additionally, our proposed PoolFormer could serve as a\\nstarting baseline for future MetaFormer architecture design. Code is available\\nat https://github.com/sail-sg/poolformer</td>\n",

Advances in the design of reliable codes have been\\ndriven by coding theory and have been sporadic.

In particular, Turbo Autoencoder (TURBOAE), introduced by Jiang\\net al., is shown to achieve the reliability of Turbo codes for Additive White\\nGaussian Noise channels. In this paper, we focus on applying the idea of\\nTURBOAE to various practical channels, such as fading channels and chirp noise\\nchannels. We introduce TURBOAE-TI, a novel neural architecture that combines\\nTURBOAE with a trainable interleaver design. We develop a carefully-designed\\ntraining procedure and a novel interleaver penalty function that are crucial in\\nlearning the interleaver and TURBOAE jointly. We demonstrate that TURBOAE-TI\\noutperforms TURBOAE and LTE Turbo codes for several channels of interest. We\\nalso provide interpretation analysis to better understand TURBOAE-TI.</td>\n",

This makes it necessary\\nto explore computational pathways for predicting defect equilibria during heat\\ntreatments. The accumulated experimental knowledge on defect transformations in\\ndiamond is unparalleled. Therefore, diamond is an excellent material for\\nbenchmarking computational approaches. By considering nitrogen, hydrogen, and\\nsilicon doped diamond as a model system, we have investigated the pressure\\ndependence of defect formation energies and calculated the defect equilibria\\nduring heat treatment of diamond through ab-initio calculations.

A common\\nbelief is their attention-based token mixer module contributes most to their\\ncompetence. However, recent works show the attention-based module in\\ntransformers can be replaced by spatial MLPs and the resulted models still\\nperform quite well. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that the general\\narchitecture of the transformers, instead of the specific token mixer module,\\nis more essential to the model's performance. To verify this, we deliberately\\nreplace the attention module in transformers with an embarrassingly simple\\nspatial pooling operator to conduct only the most basic token mixing.\\nSurprisingly, we observe that the derived model, termed as PoolFormer, achieves\\ncompetitive performance on multiple computer vision tasks. For example, on\\nImageNet-1K, PoolFormer achieves 82.1% top-1 accuracy, surpassing well-tuned\\nvision transformer/MLP-like baselines DeiT-B/ResMLP-B24 by 0.3%/1.1% accuracy\\nwith 35%/52% fewer parameters and 48%/60% fewer MACs. The effectiveness of\\nPoolFormer verifies our hypothesis and urges us to initiate the concept of\\n\"MetaFormer\", a general architecture abstracted from transformers without\\nspecifying the token mixer. Based on the extensive experiments, we argue that\\nMetaFormer is the key player in achieving superior results for recent\\ntransformer and MLP-like models on vision tasks. This work calls for more\\nfuture research dedicated to improving MetaFormer instead of focusing on the\\ntoken mixer modules. Additionally, our proposed PoolFormer could serve as a\\nstarting baseline for future MetaFormer architecture design. Code is available\\nat https://github.com/sail-sg/poolformer\n",

Advances in the design of reliable codes have been\\ndriven by coding theory and have been sporadic. Recently, it is shown that\\nchannel codes that are comparable to modern codes can be learned solely via\\ndeep learning. In particular, Turbo Autoencoder (TURBOAE), introduced by Jiang\\net al., is shown to achieve the reliability of Turbo codes for Additive White\\nGaussian Noise channels. In this paper, we focus on applying the idea of\\nTURBOAE to various practical channels, such as fading channels and chirp noise\\nchannels. We introduce TURBOAE-TI, a novel neural architecture that combines\\nTURBOAE with a trainable interleaver design. We develop a carefully-designed\\ntraining procedure and a novel interleaver penalty function that are crucial in\\nlearning the interleaver and TURBOAE jointly. We demonstrate that TURBOAE-TI\\noutperforms TURBOAE and LTE Turbo codes for several channels of interest. We\\nalso provide interpretation analysis to better understand TURBOAE-TI.\n",
              "2  Point defects are responsible for a wide range of optoelectronic properties\\nin materials, making it crucial to engineer their concentrations for novel\\nmaterials design. However, considering the plethora of defects in co-doped\\nsemiconducting and dielectric materials and the dependence of defect formation\\nenergies on heat treatment parameters, process design based on an experimental\\ntrial and error approach is not an efficient strategy. This makes it necessary\\nto explore computational pathways for predicting defect equilibria during heat\\ntreatments. The accumulated experimental knowledge on defect transformations in\\ndiamond is unparalleled. Therefore, diamond is an excellent material for\\nbenchmarking computational approaches. By considering nitrogen, hydrogen, and\\nsilicon doped diamond as a model system, we have investigated the pressure\\ndependence of defect formation energies and calculated the defect equilibria\\nduring heat treatment of diamond through ab-initio calculations.

However, recent works show the attention-based module in\\ntransformers can be replaced by spatial MLPs and the resulted models still\\nperform quite well. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that the general\\narchitecture of the transformers, instead of the specific token mixer module,\\nis more essential to the model's performance. To verify this, we deliberately\\nreplace the attention module in transformers with an embarrassingly simple\\nspatial pooling operator to conduct only the most basic token mixing.\\nSurprisingly, we observe that the derived model, termed as PoolFormer, achieves\\ncompetitive performance on multiple computer vision tasks. For example, on\\nImageNet-1K, PoolFormer achieves 82.1% top-1 accuracy, surpassing well-tuned\\nvision transformer/MLP-like baselines DeiT-B/ResMLP-B24 by 0.3%/1.1% accuracy\\nwith 35%/52% fewer parameters and 48%/60% fewer MACs. The effectiveness of\\nPoolFormer verifies our hypothesis and urges us to initiate the concept of\\n\"MetaFormer\", a general architecture abstracted from transformers without\\nspecifying the token mixer. Based on the extensive experiments, we argue that\\nMetaFormer is the key player in achieving superior results for recent\\ntransformer and MLP-like models on vision tasks. This work calls for more\\nfuture research dedicated to improving MetaFormer instead of focusing on the\\ntoken mixer modules. Additionally, our proposed PoolFormer could serve as a\\nstarting baseline for future MetaFormer architecture design. Code is available\\nat https://github.com/sail-sg/poolformer</td>\n",

              "0  a ever-growing datasets inside observational astronomy have challenged scientists inside many aspects, including an efficient and interactive data exploration and visualization. many tools have been developed to confront this challenge. however, they usually focus on displaying a actual images or focus on visualizing patterns within catalogs inside the predefined way. inside this paper we introduce vizic, the python visualization library that builds a connection between images and catalogs through an interactive map of a sky region. vizic visualizes catalog data over the custom background canvas with the help of a shape, size and orientation of each object inside a catalog. a displayed objects inside a map are highly interactive and customizable comparing to those inside a images. these objects should be filtered by or colored by their properties, such as redshift and magnitude. they also should be sub-selected with the help of the lasso-like tool considering further analysis with the help of standard python functions from in the jupyter notebook. furthermore, vizic allows custom overlays to be appended dynamically on top of a sky map. we have initially implemented several overlays, namely, voronoi, delaunay, minimum spanning tree and healpix grid layers, which are helpful considering visualizing large-scale structure. all these overlays should be generated, added or removed interactively with one line of code. a catalog data was stored inside the non-relational database, and a interfaces were developed inside javascript and python to work within jupyter notebook, which allows to create custom widgets, user generated scripts to analyze and plot a data selected/displayed inside a interactive map. this unique design makes vizic the very powerful and flexible interactive analysis tool. vizic should be adopted inside variety of exercises, considering example, data inspection, clustering analysis, galaxy alignment studies, outlier identification or simply large-scale visualizations.   \n",

              "      <td>nanostructures with open shell transition metal or molecular constituents host often strong electronic correlations and are highly sensitive to atomistic material details. this tutorial review discusses method developments and applications of theoretical approaches considering a realistic description of a electronic and magnetic properties of nanostructures with correlated electrons. first, a implementation of the flexible interface between density functional theory and the variant of dynamical mean field theory (dmft) highly suitable considering a simulation of complex correlated structures was explained and illustrated. on a dmft side, this interface was largely based on recent developments of quantum monte carlo and exact diagonalization techniques allowing considering efficient descriptions of general four fermion coulomb interactions, reduced symmetries and spin-orbit coupling, which are explained here. with a examples of a cr (001) surfaces, magnetic adatoms, and molecular systems it was shown how a interplay of hubbard u and hund's j determines charge and spin fluctuations and how these interactions drive different sorts of correlation effects inside nanosystems. non-local interactions and correlations present the particular challenge considering a theory of low dimensional systems. we present our method developments addressing these two challenges, i.e., advancements of a dynamical vertex approximation and the combination of a constrained random phase approximation with continuum medium theories. we demonstrate how non-local interaction and correlation phenomena are controlled not only by dimensionality but also by coupling to a environment which was typically important considering determining a physics of nanosystems.</td>\n",

              "      <td>stars are self-gravitating fluids inside which pressure, buoyancy, rotation and magnetic fields provide a restoring forces considering global modes of oscillation. pressure and buoyancy energetically dominate, while rotation and magnetism are generally assumed to be weak perturbations and often ignored. however, observations of anomalously weak dipole mode amplitudes inside red giant stars suggest that the substantial fraction of these are subject to an additional source of damping localised to their core region, with indirect evidence pointing to a role of the deeply buried magnetic field. it was also known that inside many instances a gravity-mode character of affected modes was preserved, but so far no effective damping mechanism has been proposed that accommodates this aspect. here we present such the mechanism, which damps a oscillations of stars harbouring magnetised cores using resonant interactions with standing alfvén modes of high harmonic index. a damping rates produced by this mechanism are quantitatively on par with those associated with turbulent convection, and inside a range required to explain observations, considering realistic stellar models and magnetic field strengths. our results suggest that magnetic fields should provide an efficient means of damping stellar oscillations without needing to disrupt a internal structure of a modes, and lay a groundwork considering an extension of a theory of global stellar oscillations that incorporates these effects.</td>\n",

              "      <td>deep neural perception and control networks are likely to be the key component of self-driving vehicles. these models need to be explainable - they should provide easy-to-interpret rationales considering their behavior - so that passengers, insurance companies, law enforcement, developers etc., should understand what triggered the particular behavior. here we explore a use of visual explanations. these explanations take a form of real-time highlighted regions of an image that causally influence a network's output (steering control). our idea behind the method was two-stage. inside a first stage, we use the visual attention model to train the convolution network end-to-end from images to steering angle. a attention model highlights image regions that potentially influence a network's output. some of these are true influences, but some are spurious. we then apply the causal filtering step to determine which input regions actually influence a output. this produces more succinct visual explanations and more accurately exposes a network's behavior. we demonstrate a effectiveness of our model on three datasets totaling 16 hours of driving. we first show that training with attention does not degrade a performance of a end-to-end network. then we show that a network causally cues on the variety of features that are used by humans while driving.</td>\n",

              "0    Predictive models allow subject-specific inference when analyzing disease\\nrelated alterations in neuroimaging data. Given a subject's data, inference can\\nbe made at two levels: global, i.e. identifiying condition presence for the\\nsubject, and local, i.e. detecting condition effect on each individual\\nmeasurement extracted from the subject's data. While global inference is widely\\nused, local inference, which can be used to form subject-specific effect maps,\\nis rarely used because existing models often yield noisy detections composed of\\ndispersed isolated islands. In this article, we propose a reconstruction\\nmethod, named RSM, to improve subject-specific detections of predictive\\nmodeling approaches and in particular, binary classifiers. RSM specifically\\naims to reduce noise due to sampling error associated with using a finite\\nsample of examples to train classifiers. The proposed method is a wrapper-type\\nalgorithm that can be used with different binary classifiers in a diagnostic\\nmanner, i.e. without information on condition presence. Reconstruction is posed\\nas a Maximum-A-Posteriori problem with a prior model whose parameters are\\nestimated from training data in a classifier-specific fashion. Experimental\\nevaluation is performed on synthetically generated data and data from the\\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Results on\\nsynthetic data demonstrate that using RSM yields higher detection accuracy\\ncompared to using models directly or with bootstrap averaging.

              "      <td>Predictive models allow subject-specific inference when analyzing disease\\nrelated alterations in neuroimaging data. Given a subject's data, inference can\\nbe made at two levels: global, i.e. identifiying condition presence for the\\nsubject, and local, i.e. detecting condition effect on each individual\\nmeasurement extracted from the subject's data. While global inference is widely\\nused, local inference, which can be used to form subject-specific effect maps,\\nis rarely used because existing models often yield noisy detections composed of\\ndispersed isolated islands. In this article, we propose a reconstruction\\nmethod, named RSM, to improve subject-specific detections of predictive\\nmodeling approaches and in particular, binary classifiers. RSM specifically\\naims to reduce noise due to sampling error associated with using a finite\\nsample of examples to train classifiers. The proposed method is a wrapper-type\\nalgorithm that can be used with different binary classifiers in a diagnostic\\nmanner, i.e. without information on condition presence. Reconstruction is posed\\nas a Maximum-A-Posteriori problem with a prior model whose parameters are\\nestimated from training data in a classifier-specific fashion. Experimental\\nevaluation is performed on synthetically generated data and data from the\\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Results on\\nsynthetic data demonstrate that using RSM yields higher detection accuracy\\ncompared to using models directly or with bootstrap averaging. Analyses on the\\nADNI dataset show that RSM can also improve correlation between\\nsubject-specific detections in cortical thickness data and non-imaging markers\\nof Alzheimer's Disease (AD), such as the Mini Mental State Examination Score\\nand Cerebrospinal Fluid amyloid-$\\beta$ levels. Further reliability studies on\\nthe longitudinal ADNI dataset show improvement on detection reliability when\\nRSM is used.\\n</td>\n",

              "0     Predictive models allow subject-specific inference when analyzing disease\\nrelated alterations in neuroimaging data. Given a subject's data, inference can\\nbe made at two levels: global, i.e. identifiying condition presence for the\\nsubject, and local, i.e. detecting condition effect on each individual\\nmeasurement extracted from the subject's data. While global inference is widely\\nused, local inference, which can be used to form subject-specific effect maps,\\nis rarely used because existing models often yield noisy detections composed of\\ndispersed isolated islands. In this article, we propose a reconstruction\\nmethod, named RSM, to improve subject-specific detections of predictive\\nmodeling approaches and in particular, binary classifiers. RSM specifically\\naims to reduce noise due to sampling error associated with using a finite\\nsample of examples to train classifiers. The proposed method is a wrapper-type\\nalgorithm that can be used with different binary classifiers in a diagnostic\\nmanner, i.e. without information on condition presence. Reconstruction is posed\\nas a Maximum-A-Posteriori problem with a prior model whose parameters are\\nestimated from training data in a classifier-specific fashion. Experimental\\nevaluation is performed on synthetically generated data and data from the\\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Results on\\nsynthetic data demonstrate that using RSM yields higher detection accuracy\\ncompared to using models directly or with bootstrap averaging. Analyses on the\\nADNI dataset show that RSM can also improve correlation between\\nsubject-specific detections in cortical thickness data and non-imaging markers\\nof Alzheimer's Disease (AD), such as the Mini Mental State Examination Score\\nand Cerebrospinal Fluid amyloid-$\\beta$ levels. Further reliability studies on\\nthe longitudinal ADNI dataset show improvement on detection reliability when\\nRSM is used.\\n   \n",

In this paper, we bring a new architecture in convolutional\\nneural network (CNN) named cyclic convolutional layer to achieve rotation\\ninvariance in 2-D symbol recognition. We can also get the position and\\norientation of the 2-D symbol by the network to achieve detection purpose for\\nmultiple non-overlap target. Last but not least, this architecture can achieve\\none-shot learning in some cases using those invariance.\\n   \n",

A\\nfully-coupled poroelastic hydraulic fracture model is used to account for pore\\npressure and stress changes due to production.

The main findings of this research are: (i) mobility,\\nproduction pressure, and fracture half-length are the main contributors to the\\nchanges in the quantities of interest. The percentage of the contribution of\\neach parameter depends on the location with respect to pre-existing hydraulic\\nfractures and the quantity of interest. (ii) As the time progresses, the effect\\nof mobility decreases and the effect of production pressure increases. (iii)\\nThese two variables are also dominant for horizontal stresses at large\\ndistances from hydraulic fractures. (iv) At zones close to hydraulic fracture\\ntips or inside the spacing area, other parameters such as fracture spacing and\\nhalf-length are the dominant factors that affect the minimum horizontal stress.\\nThe results of this study will provide useful guidelines for the stimulation\\ndesign of legacy wells and secondary operations such as refracturing and infill\\ndrilling.\\n   \n",

Various modifications of this correspondence appeared, with more\\ngeneral classes of regular languages on one hand and classes of more complex\\nalgebraic structures on the other hand. For example, classes of languages need\\nnot be closed under complementation or all preimages under homomorphisms, while\\nmonoids can be equipped with a compatible order or they can have a\\ndistinguished set of generators. Such generalized varieties and pseudovarieties\\nalso have natural counterparts formed by classes of finite (ordered) automata.\\nIn this paper the previous approaches are combined. The notion of positive\\n$\\mathcal C$-varieties of ordered semiautomata (i.e. no initial and final\\nstates are specified) is introduced and their correspondence with positive\\n$\\mathcal C$-varieties of languages is proved.\\n   \n",

              "      <td>Predictive models allow subject-specific inference when analyzing disease\\nrelated alterations in neuroimaging data. Given a subject's data, inference can\\nbe made at two levels: global, i.e. identifiying condition presence for the\\nsubject, and local, i.e. detecting condition effect on each individual\\nmeasurement extracted from the subject's data. While global inference is widely\\nused, local inference, which can be used to form subject-specific effect maps,\\nis rarely used because existing models often yield noisy detections composed of\\ndispersed isolated islands. In this article, we propose a reconstruction\\nmethod, named RSM, to improve subject-specific detections of predictive\\nmodeling approaches and in particular, binary classifiers. RSM specifically\\naims to reduce noise due to sampling error associated with using a finite\\nsample of examples to train classifiers. The proposed method is a wrapper-type\\nalgorithm that can be used with different binary classifiers in a diagnostic\\nmanner, i.e. without information on condition presence. Reconstruction is posed\\nas a Maximum-A-Posteriori problem with a prior model whose parameters are\\nestimated from training data in a classifier-specific fashion. Experimental\\nevaluation is performed on synthetically generated data and data from the\\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Results on\\nsynthetic data demonstrate that using RSM yields higher detection accuracy\\ncompared to using models directly or with bootstrap averaging. Analyses on the\\nADNI dataset show that RSM can also improve correlation between\\nsubject-specific detections in cortical thickness data and non-imaging markers\\nof Alzheimer's Disease (AD), such as the Mini Mental State Examination Score\\nand Cerebrospinal Fluid amyloid-$\\beta$ levels. Further reliability studies on\\nthe longitudinal ADNI dataset show improvement on detection reliability when\\nRSM is used.\\n</td>\n",

A\\nfully-coupled poroelastic hydraulic fracture model is used to account for pore\\npressure and stress changes due to production. To ease the computational cost\\nof a simulator, we also provide reduced order models (ROMs), which can be used\\nto replace the complex numerical model with a rather simple analytical model,\\nfor calculating the pore pressure and stresses at different locations around\\nhydraulic fractures. The main findings of this research are: (i) mobility,\\nproduction pressure, and fracture half-length are the main contributors to the\\nchanges in the quantities of interest. The percentage of the contribution of\\neach parameter depends on the location with respect to pre-existing hydraulic\\nfractures and the quantity of interest. (ii) As the time progresses, the effect\\nof mobility decreases and the effect of production pressure increases. (iii)\\nThese two variables are also dominant for horizontal stresses at large\\ndistances from hydraulic fractures. (iv) At zones close to hydraulic fracture\\ntips or inside the spacing area, other parameters such as fracture spacing and\\nhalf-length are the dominant factors that affect the minimum horizontal stress.\\nThe results of this study will provide useful guidelines for the stimulation\\ndesign of legacy wells and secondary operations such as refracturing and infill\\ndrilling.\\n</td>\n",

              "0     Predictive models allow subject-specific inference when analyzing disease\\nrelated alterations in neuroimaging data. Given a subject's data, inference can\\nbe made at two levels: global, i.e. identifiying condition presence for the\\nsubject, and local, i.e. detecting condition effect on each individual\\nmeasurement extracted from the subject's data. While global inference is widely\\nused, local inference, which can be used to form subject-specific effect maps,\\nis rarely used because existing models often yield noisy detections composed of\\ndispersed isolated islands. In this article, we propose a reconstruction\\nmethod, named RSM, to improve subject-specific detections of predictive\\nmodeling approaches and in particular, binary classifiers. RSM specifically\\naims to reduce noise due to sampling error associated with using a finite\\nsample of examples to train classifiers. The proposed method is a wrapper-type\\nalgorithm that can be used with different binary classifiers in a diagnostic\\nmanner, i.e. without information on condition presence. Reconstruction is posed\\nas a Maximum-A-Posteriori problem with a prior model whose parameters are\\nestimated from training data in a classifier-specific fashion. Experimental\\nevaluation is performed on synthetically generated data and data from the\\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Results on\\nsynthetic data demonstrate that using RSM yields higher detection accuracy\\ncompared to using models directly or with bootstrap averaging. Analyses on the\\nADNI dataset show that RSM can also improve correlation between\\nsubject-specific detections in cortical thickness data and non-imaging markers\\nof Alzheimer's Disease (AD), such as the Mini Mental State Examination Score\\nand Cerebrospinal Fluid amyloid-$\\beta$ levels. Further reliability studies on\\nthe longitudinal ADNI dataset show improvement on detection reliability when\\nRSM is used.\\n\n",

Given a subject's data, inference can\\nbe made at two levels: global, i.e. identifiying condition presence for the\\nsubject, and local, i.e. detecting condition effect on each individual\\nmeasurement extracted from the subject's data. While global inference is widely\\nused, local inference, which can be used to form subject-specific effect maps,\\nis rarely used because existing models often yield noisy detections composed of\\ndispersed isolated islands. In this article, we propose a reconstruction\\nmethod, named RSM, to improve subject-specific detections of predictive\\nmodeling approaches and in particular, binary classifiers. RSM specifically\\naims to reduce noise due to sampling error associated with using a finite\\nsample of examples to train classifiers. The proposed method is a wrapper-type\\nalgorithm that can be used with different binary classifiers in a diagnostic\\nmanner, i.e. without information on condition presence. Reconstruction is posed\\nas a Maximum-A-Posteriori problem with a prior model whose parameters are\\nestimated from training data in a classifier-specific fashion. Experimental\\nevaluation is performed on synthetically generated data and data from the\\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Results on\\nsynthetic data demonstrate that using RSM yields higher detection accuracy\\ncompared to using models directly or with bootstrap averaging. Analyses on the\\nADNI dataset show that RSM can also improve correlation between\\nsubject-specific detections in cortical thickness data and non-imaging markers\\nof Alzheimer's Disease (AD), such as the Mini Mental State Examination Score\\nand Cerebrospinal Fluid amyloid-$\\beta$ levels. Further reliability studies on\\nthe longitudinal ADNI dataset show improvement on detection reliability when\\nRSM is used.\\n</td>\n",

A\\nfully-coupled poroelastic hydraulic fracture model is used to account for pore\\npressure and stress changes due to production. To ease the computational cost\\nof a simulator, we also provide reduced order models (ROMs), which can be used\\nto replace the complex numerical model with a rather simple analytical model,\\nfor calculating the pore pressure and stresses at different locations around\\nhydraulic fractures. The main findings of this research are: (i) mobility,\\nproduction pressure, and fracture half-length are the main contributors to the\\nchanges in the quantities of interest. The percentage of the contribution of\\neach parameter depends on the location with respect to pre-existing hydraulic\\nfractures and the quantity of interest. (ii) As the time progresses, the effect\\nof mobility decreases and the effect of production pressure increases. (iii)\\nThese two variables are also dominant for horizontal stresses at large\\ndistances from hydraulic fractures. (iv) At zones close to hydraulic fracture\\ntips or inside the spacing area, other parameters such as fracture spacing and\\nhalf-length are the dominant factors that affect the minimum horizontal stress.\\nThe results of this study will provide useful guidelines for the stimulation\\ndesign of legacy wells and secondary operations such as refracturing and infill\\ndrilling.\\n</td>\n",

              "0  OBJECTIVE: This retrospective chart review describes the epidemiology and clinical features of 40 patients with culture-proven Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections at King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Patients with positive M. pneumoniae cultures from respiratory specimens from January 1997 through December 1998 were identified through the Microbiology records. Charts of patients were reviewed. RESULTS: 40 patients were identified, 33 (82.5%) of whom required admission. Most infections (92.5%) were community-acquired. The infection affected all age groups but was most common in infants (32.5%) and pre-school children (22.5%). It occurred year-round but was most common in the fall (35%) and spring (30%). More than three-quarters of patients (77.5%) had comorbidities. Twenty-four isolates (60%) were associated with pneumonia, 14 (35%) with upper respiratory tract infections, and 2 (5%) with bronchiolitis. Cough (82.5%), fever (75%), and malaise (58.8%) were the most common symptoms, and crepitations (60%), and wheezes (40%) were the most common signs. Most patients with pneumonia had crepitations (79.2%) but only 25% had bronchial breathing. Immunocompromised patients were more likely than non-immunocompromised patients to present with pneumonia (8/9 versus 16/31, P = 0.05). Of the 24 patients with pneumonia, 14 (58.3%) had uneventful recovery, 4 (16.7%) recovered following some complications, 3 (12.5%) died because of M pneumoniae infection, and 3 (12.5%) died due to underlying comorbidities. The 3 patients who died of M pneumoniae pneumonia had other comorbidities. CONCLUSION: our results were similar to published data except for the finding that infections were more common in infants and preschool children and that the mortality rate of pneumonia in patients with comorbidities was high.   \n",

Although NO• is known to have anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, various lines of evidence support the contribution of NO• to lung injury in several disease models. On the basis of biochemical evidence, it is often presumed that such NO• -dependent oxidations are due to the formation of the oxidant peroxynitrite, although alternative mechanisms involving the phagocyte-derived heme proteins myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase might be operative during conditions of inflammation. Because of the overwhelming literature on NO• generation and activities in the respiratory tract, it would be beyond the scope of this commentary to review this area comprehensively. Instead, it focuses on recent evidence and concepts of the presumed contribution of NO• to inflammatory diseases of the lung.   \n",

SP-D is synthesized and secreted by alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells, but is also expressed by epithelial cells lining various exocrine ducts and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. SP-D, a collagenous calcium-dependent lectin (or collectin), binds to surface glycoconjugates expressed by a wide variety of microorganisms, and to oligosaccharides associated with the surface of various complex organic antigens. SP-D also specifically interacts with glycoconjugates and other molecules expressed on the surface of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. In addition, SP-D binds to specific surfactant-associated lipids and can influence the organization of lipid mixtures containing phosphatidylinositol in vitro. Consistent with these diverse in vitro activities is the observation that SP-D-deficient transgenic mice show abnormal accumulations of surfactant lipids, and respond abnormally to challenge with respiratory viruses and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. The phenotype of macrophages isolated from the lungs of SP-D-deficient mice is altered, and there is circumstantial evidence that abnormal oxidant metabolism and/or increased metalloproteinase expression contributes to the development of emphysema. The expression of SP-D is increased in response to many forms of lung injury, and deficient accumulation of appropriately oligomerized SP-D might contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of human lung diseases.   \n",

The respiratory epithelial target cells respond to viral infection with specific alterations in gene expression, including production of chemoattractant cytokines, adhesion molecules, elements that are related to the apoptosis response, and others that remain incompletely understood. Here we review our current understanding of these mucosal responses and discuss several genomic approaches, including differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gene array strategies, that will permit us to unravel the nature of these responses in a more complete and systematic manner.   \n",

METHODS: Patients with positive M. pneumoniae cultures from respiratory specimens from January 1997 through December 1998 were identified through the Microbiology records. Charts of patients were reviewed. RESULTS: 40 patients were identified, 33 (82.5%) of whom required admission. Most infections (92.5%) were community-acquired. The infection affected all age groups but was most common in infants (32.5%) and pre-school children (22.5%). It occurred year-round but was most common in the fall (35%) and spring (30%). More than three-quarters of patients (77.5%) had comorbidities. Twenty-four isolates (60%) were associated with pneumonia, 14 (35%) with upper respiratory tract infections, and 2 (5%) with bronchiolitis. Cough (82.5%), fever (75%), and malaise (58.8%) were the most common symptoms, and crepitations (60%), and wheezes (40%) were the most common signs. Most patients with pneumonia had crepitations (79.2%) but only 25% had bronchial breathing. Immunocompromised patients were more likely than non-immunocompromised patients to present with pneumonia (8/9 versus 16/31, P = 0.05). Of the 24 patients with pneumonia, 14 (58.3%) had uneventful recovery, 4 (16.7%) recovered following some complications, 3 (12.5%) died because of M pneumoniae infection, and 3 (12.5%) died due to underlying comorbidities. The 3 patients who died of M pneumoniae pneumonia had other comorbidities. CONCLUSION: our results were similar to published data except for the finding that infections were more common in infants and preschool children and that the mortality rate of pneumonia in patients with comorbidities was high.</td>\n",

Although NO• is known to have anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, various lines of evidence support the contribution of NO• to lung injury in several disease models. On the basis of biochemical evidence, it is often presumed that such NO• -dependent oxidations are due to the formation of the oxidant peroxynitrite, although alternative mechanisms involving the phagocyte-derived heme proteins myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase might be operative during conditions of inflammation. Because of the overwhelming literature on NO• generation and activities in the respiratory tract, it would be beyond the scope of this commentary to review this area comprehensively. Instead, it focuses on recent evidence and concepts of the presumed contribution of NO• to inflammatory diseases of the lung.</td>\n",

SP-D is synthesized and secreted by alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells, but is also expressed by epithelial cells lining various exocrine ducts and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. SP-D, a collagenous calcium-dependent lectin (or collectin), binds to surface glycoconjugates expressed by a wide variety of microorganisms, and to oligosaccharides associated with the surface of various complex organic antigens. SP-D also specifically interacts with glycoconjugates and other molecules expressed on the surface of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. In addition, SP-D binds to specific surfactant-associated lipids and can influence the organization of lipid mixtures containing phosphatidylinositol in vitro. Consistent with these diverse in vitro activities is the observation that SP-D-deficient transgenic mice show abnormal accumulations of surfactant lipids, and respond abnormally to challenge with respiratory viruses and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. The phenotype of macrophages isolated from the lungs of SP-D-deficient mice is altered, and there is circumstantial evidence that abnormal oxidant metabolism and/or increased metalloproteinase expression contributes to the development of emphysema. The expression of SP-D is increased in response to many forms of lung injury, and deficient accumulation of appropriately oligomerized SP-D might contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of human lung diseases.</td>\n",

              "0  OBJECTIVE: This retrospective chart review describes the epidemiology and clinical features of 40 patients with culture-proven Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections at King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Patients with positive M. pneumoniae cultures from respiratory specimens from January 1997 through December 1998 were identified through the Microbiology records. Charts of patients were reviewed. RESULTS: 40 patients were identified, 33 (82.5%) of whom required admission. Most infections (92.5%) were community-acquired. The infection affected all age groups but was most common in infants (32.5%) and pre-school children (22.5%). It occurred year-round but was most common in the fall (35%) and spring (30%). More than three-quarters of patients (77.5%) had comorbidities. Twenty-four isolates (60%) were associated with pneumonia, 14 (35%) with upper respiratory tract infections, and 2 (5%) with bronchiolitis. Cough (82.5%), fever (75%), and malaise (58.8%) were the most common symptoms, and crepitations (60%), and wheezes (40%) were the most common signs. Most patients with pneumonia had crepitations (79.2%) but only 25% had bronchial breathing. Immunocompromised patients were more likely than non-immunocompromised patients to present with pneumonia (8/9 versus 16/31, P = 0.05). Of the 24 patients with pneumonia, 14 (58.3%) had uneventful recovery, 4 (16.7%) recovered following some complications, 3 (12.5%) died because of M pneumoniae infection, and 3 (12.5%) died due to underlying comorbidities. The 3 patients who died of M pneumoniae pneumonia had other comorbidities. CONCLUSION: our results were similar to published data except for the finding that infections were more common in infants and preschool children and that the mortality rate of pneumonia in patients with comorbidities was high.\n",

Although NO• is known to have anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, various lines of evidence support the contribution of NO• to lung injury in several disease models. On the basis of biochemical evidence, it is often presumed that such NO• -dependent oxidations are due to the formation of the oxidant peroxynitrite, although alternative mechanisms involving the phagocyte-derived heme proteins myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase might be operative during conditions of inflammation.

SP-D is synthesized and secreted by alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells, but is also expressed by epithelial cells lining various exocrine ducts and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. SP-D, a collagenous calcium-dependent lectin (or collectin), binds to surface glycoconjugates expressed by a wide variety of microorganisms, and to oligosaccharides associated with the surface of various complex organic antigens. SP-D also specifically interacts with glycoconjugates and other molecules expressed on the surface of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. In addition, SP-D binds to specific surfactant-associated lipids and can influence the organization of lipid mixtures containing phosphatidylinositol in vitro. Consistent with these diverse in vitro activities is the observation that SP-D-deficient transgenic mice show abnormal accumulations of surfactant lipids, and respond abnormally to challenge with respiratory viruses and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. The phenotype of macrophages isolated from the lungs of SP-D-deficient mice is altered, and there is circumstantial evidence that abnormal oxidant metabolism and/or increased metalloproteinase expression contributes to the development of emphysema. The expression of SP-D is increased in response to many forms of lung injury, and deficient accumulation of appropriately oligomerized SP-D might contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of human lung diseases.\n",

              "      <td>OBJECTIVE: This retrospective chart review describes the epidemiology and clinical features of 40 patients with culture-proven Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections at King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Patients with positive M. pneumoniae cultures from respiratory specimens from January 1997 through December 1998 were identified through the Microbiology records. Charts of patients were reviewed. RESULTS: 40 patients were identified, 33 (82.5%) of whom required admission. Most infections (92.5%) were community-acquired. The infection affected all age groups but was most common in infants (32.5%) and pre-school children (22.5%). It occurred year-round but was most common in the fall (35%) and spring (30%). More than three-quarters of patients (77.5%) had comorbidities. Twenty-four isolates (60%) were associated with pneumonia, 14 (35%) with upper respiratory tract infections, and 2 (5%) with bronchiolitis. Cough (82.5%), fever (75%), and malaise (58.8%) were the most common symptoms, and crepitations (60%), and wheezes (40%) were the most common signs. Most patients with pneumonia had crepitations (79.2%) but only 25% had bronchial breathing. Immunocompromised patients were more likely than non-immunocompromised patients to present with pneumonia (8/9 versus 16/31, P = 0.05). Of the 24 patients with pneumonia, 14 (58.3%) had uneventful recovery, 4 (16.7%) recovered following some complications, 3 (12.5%) died because of M pneumoniae infection, and 3 (12.5%) died due to underlying comorbidities. The 3 patients who died of M pneumoniae pneumonia had other comorbidities. CONCLUSION: our results were similar to published data except for the finding that infections were more common in infants and preschool children and that the mortality rate of pneumonia in patients with comorbidities was high.</td>\n",

On the basis of biochemical evidence, it is often presumed that such NO• -dependent oxidations are due to the formation of the oxidant peroxynitrite, although alternative mechanisms involving the phagocyte-derived heme proteins myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase might be operative during conditions of inflammation.

              "0  OBJECTIVE: This retrospective chart review describes the epidemiology and clinical features of 40 patients with culture-proven Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections at King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Patients with positive M. pneumoniae cultures from respiratory specimens from January 1997 through December 1998 were identified through the Microbiology records. Charts of patients were reviewed. RESULTS: 40 patients were identified, 33 (82.5%) of whom required admission. Most infections (92.5%) were community-acquired. The infection affected all age groups but was most common in infants (32.5%) and pre-school children (22.5%). It occurred year-round but was most common in the fall (35%) and spring (30%). More than three-quarters of patients (77.5%) had comorbidities. Twenty-four isolates (60%) were associated with pneumonia, 14 (35%) with upper respiratory tract infections, and 2 (5%) with bronchiolitis. Cough (82.5%), fever (75%), and malaise (58.8%) were the most common symptoms, and crepitations (60%), and wheezes (40%) were the most common signs. Most patients with pneumonia had crepitations (79.2%) but only 25% had bronchial breathing. Immunocompromised patients were more likely than non-immunocompromised patients to present with pneumonia (8/9 versus 16/31, P = 0.05). Of the 24 patients with pneumonia, 14 (58.3%) had uneventful recovery, 4 (16.7%) recovered following some complications, 3 (12.5%) died because of M pneumoniae infection, and 3 (12.5%) died due to underlying comorbidities. The 3 patients who died of M pneumoniae pneumonia had other comorbidities. CONCLUSION: our results were similar to published data except for the finding that infections were more common in infants and preschool children and that the mortality rate of pneumonia in patients with comorbidities was high.\n",

Although NO• is known to have anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, various lines of evidence support the contribution of NO• to lung injury in several disease models. On the basis of biochemical evidence, it is often presumed that such NO• -dependent oxidations are due to the formation of the oxidant peroxynitrite, although alternative mechanisms involving the phagocyte-derived heme proteins myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase might be operative during conditions of inflammation. Because of the overwhelming literature on NO• generation and activities in the respiratory tract, it would be beyond the scope of this commentary to review this area comprehensively. Instead, it focuses on recent evidence and concepts of the presumed contribution of NO• to inflammatory diseases of the lung.\n",

SP-D is synthesized and secreted by alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells, but is also expressed by epithelial cells lining various exocrine ducts and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. SP-D, a collagenous calcium-dependent lectin (or collectin), binds to surface glycoconjugates expressed by a wide variety of microorganisms, and to oligosaccharides associated with the surface of various complex organic antigens. SP-D also specifically interacts with glycoconjugates and other molecules expressed on the surface of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. In addition, SP-D binds to specific surfactant-associated lipids and can influence the organization of lipid mixtures containing phosphatidylinositol in vitro. Consistent with these diverse in vitro activities is the observation that SP-D-deficient transgenic mice show abnormal accumulations of surfactant lipids, and respond abnormally to challenge with respiratory viruses and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. The phenotype of macrophages isolated from the lungs of SP-D-deficient mice is altered, and there is circumstantial evidence that abnormal oxidant metabolism and/or increased metalloproteinase expression contributes to the development of emphysema. The expression of SP-D is increased in response to many forms of lung injury, and deficient accumulation of appropriately oligomerized SP-D might contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of human lung diseases.\n",

METHODS: Patients with positive M. pneumoniae cultures from respiratory specimens from January 1997 through December 1998 were identified through the Microbiology records. Charts of patients were reviewed. RESULTS: 40 patients were identified, 33 (82.5%) of whom required admission. Most infections (92.5%) were community-acquired. The infection affected all age groups but was most common in infants (32.5%) and pre-school children (22.5%). It occurred year-round but was most common in the fall (35%) and spring (30%). More than three-quarters of patients (77.5%) had comorbidities. Twenty-four isolates (60%) were associated with pneumonia, 14 (35%) with upper respiratory tract infections, and 2 (5%) with bronchiolitis. Cough (82.5%), fever (75%), and malaise (58.8%) were the most common symptoms, and crepitations (60%), and wheezes (40%) were the most common signs. Most patients with pneumonia had crepitations (79.2%) but only 25% had bronchial breathing. Immunocompromised patients were more likely than non-immunocompromised patients to present with pneumonia (8/9 versus 16/31, P = 0.05). Of the 24 patients with pneumonia, 14 (58.3%) had uneventful recovery, 4 (16.7%) recovered following some complications, 3 (12.5%) died because of M pneumoniae infection, and 3 (12.5%) died due to underlying comorbidities. The 3 patients who died of M pneumoniae pneumonia had other comorbidities. CONCLUSION: our results were similar to published data except for the finding that infections were more common in infants and preschool children and that the mortality rate of pneumonia in patients with comorbidities was high.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract are commonly associated with elevated production of nitric oxide (NO•) and increased indices of NO• -dependent oxidative stress. Although NO• is known to have anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, various lines of evidence support the contribution of NO• to lung injury in several disease models. On the basis of biochemical evidence, it is often presumed that such NO• -dependent oxidations are due to the formation of the oxidant peroxynitrite, although alternative mechanisms involving the phagocyte-derived heme proteins myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase might be operative during conditions of inflammation. Because of the overwhelming literature on NO• generation and activities in the respiratory tract, it would be beyond the scope of this commentary to review this area comprehensively. Instead, it focuses on recent evidence and concepts of the presumed contribution of NO• to inflammatory diseases of the lung.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Surfactant protein-D (SP-D) participates in the innate response to inhaled microorganisms and organic antigens, and contributes to immune and inflammatory regulation within the lung. SP-D is synthesized and secreted by alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells, but is also expressed by epithelial cells lining various exocrine ducts and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. SP-D, a collagenous calcium-dependent lectin (or collectin), binds to surface glycoconjugates expressed by a wide variety of microorganisms, and to oligosaccharides associated with the surface of various complex organic antigens. SP-D also specifically interacts with glycoconjugates and other molecules expressed on the surface of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. In addition, SP-D binds to specific surfactant-associated lipids and can influence the organization of lipid mixtures containing phosphatidylinositol in vitro. Consistent with these diverse in vitro activities is the observation that SP-D-deficient transgenic mice show abnormal accumulations of surfactant lipids, and respond abnormally to challenge with respiratory viruses and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. The phenotype of macrophages isolated from the lungs of SP-D-deficient mice is altered, and there is circumstantial evidence that abnormal oxidant metabolism and/or increased metalloproteinase expression contributes to the development of emphysema. The expression of SP-D is increased in response to many forms of lung injury, and deficient accumulation of appropriately oligomerized SP-D might contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of human lung diseases.</td>\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 NDV (Roakin strain) was obtained from Dr. D. J. King, Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, Athens, GA. The virus was propagated by inoculation of 10-d-old embryonated chicken eggs by the allantoic route, 0.1 ml per egg (SPAFAS, Charles River Laboratories Inc., Wilmington, MA). Allantoic fluid was harvested from eggs that died 3–4 d postinoculation. Titration of the virus was accomplished by preparation of 10-fold dilutions of allantoic fluid in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) and inoculation of 0.2 ml of each dilution onto confluent monolayers of chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells in 48-well tissue culture plates, four wells per dilution. Five days after inoculation, contents of wells were decanted into a container containing sodium hypochlorite to inactivate live virus, and cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Titer was determined by calculation of the 50% infectious doses (ID50) as described by Reed and Muench (1938). An inoculum was prepared to contain ≈107 ID50/0.1 ml, and it was stored at −70°C.\\nSerum samples were assayed for presence of NDV-specific antibody by using a hemagglutination inhibition test as described previously (Beard 1989).\\nHouse flies used in this study have been maintained in culture at North Carolina State University since 1997. The colony was established from wild-captured flies from a dairy. Collected house fly eggs were added to a prepared house fly larval medium. Fly larvae were reared in sweater boxes at constant temperature (27°C) until pupation. The fly pupae were harvested by flotation 8 d after egg hatch. House fly pupae were stored at room temperature until adult emergence 3 d later. All flies emerging within a 24-h period represent day 0. Adult flies were provided food and water. Once the flies were 3–5 d old, they were separated for use in these experiments.\\nFertile specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken eggs were obtained from SPAFAS, Charles River Laboratories, Inc. Eggs were incubated and hatched at North Carolina State University. One-day-old chickens were housed in electrically heated brooders in an isolation room until chickens were 2 wk of age. Chickens were provided nonmedicated game bird starter and water ad libitum.\\nFour experiments were conducted to examine the survival of NDV in the digestive tract tissues, crops, and intestines (mid- and hindgut) of flies after exposure to NDV (Roakin) and the ability of NDV-exposed flies to transmit the virus to susceptible chicks.\\nAdult flies of mixed sex were separated into two groups of 350 flies each. Adult flies were held for 18 h at 22°C in screened containers without food or water. Flies were anesthetized with cold by placement in a −20°C freezer for 5 min. Small plastic reservoirs containing ≈2,000 μl of NDV (Roakin) inoculum was placed in each fly cage. The control group (n = 350) was administered DMEM without NDV. The flies were given 30 min to fully recover from the cold and to consume the treated and untreated medium.\\n\\nExperiment 1. Survival of NDV in the fly crop, a storage site for liquids before passage to the midgut, was evaluated. After ingestion of the medium, each treatment group was provided food and water and held at room temperature (≈22°C). At 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 96 h postfeeding, the flies were temporarily chilled, and 40 flies were removed from each treatment group. These flies were placed in sterile petri dishes, the dish was labeled for treatment and time interval, and frozen at −70°C.\\nFrozen flies were surface sterilized by immersing the flies in 95% ethanol (EtOH), transferred to 10% bleach (NaOCl) a minimum of 3 min, and rinsed in distilled sterile water. Whole crops (n = 40) were aseptically removed from the flies, pooled, and placed in 2 ml of chilled DMEM plus 1% fetal bovine serum, 1% gentamicin, and amphotericin B. Dissection instruments were sterilized in dilute bleach and EtOH after each dissection. Pooled fly crops were frozen at −70°C. The experiment was replicated three times.\\nPooled fly crops in DMEM with antibiotics were homogenized and clarified by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 20 min at 4°C. Clarified homogenates were prepared as 10-fold dilutions and then assayed for NDV as described above. Presence of virus in samples was determined by titration in CEF cells as described above.\\n\\nExperiment 2. Survival of NDV in house fly intestines was evaluated. A time-delineated experiment was conducted to examine the presence of NDV in the digestive tract of the house fly. Flies were separated into two groups of 350 flies and administered NDV as described above. Groups of 40 flies were examined for the presence of virus at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 96 h postfeeding. Target tissues for experiment 2 were fly mid- and hindgut. After surface sterilization, the terminal abdominal plate was excised and the intestinal tract was gently pulled through the opening. Separating at the proventriculus, the mid- and hindgut tissues remained intact. If gut or crop was compromised, the fly was rejected. Gut tissues were excised from flies (n = 40), pooled, and placed in 2 ml of chilled DMEM supplemented with antibiotics. Pooled fly gut tissues were stored frozen at −70°C. Gut tissues were homogenized and assayed for the presence of virus as described above.\\nFor analysis, Mean NDV titers were calculated from each replicate time interval for crop and gut tissue. We used correlation to test the relationship between live virus titer and time. Regression analysis was used to plot the relationship of titer decay against time. The slope of the curve was calculated using a logarithmic regression model (Minitab, Inc. 1997).\\n\\nExperiment 3. The potential of the house fly to directly transmit NDV to live chicks was investigated. Fourteen-day-old chickens were divided into groups of 10 birds and placed in Horsfall isolation units with negative-pressure ventilation. Chicks were exposed to fly densities of 10, 100, and 250 house flies per isolation unit, and a no fly control for four treatments and replicated twice within experiment and the experiment was conducted twice.\\nApproximately 800 adult house flies (3–5 d old) were divided into three feeding chambers, each holding ≈265 flies. Starved flies were provided NDV-inoculated medium in a reservoir as described above. After the inoculum was consumed, the flies were cold anesthetized and further sorted into two groups of 10 flies, two groups of 100 flies, and two groups of 250 flies. Two hours postfeeding, the flies were released in the isolation chambers, and the bird behavior was observed. One day after the flies were released in the brooders, the fresh air intake was sprayed with 0.30% pyrethrin insecticide synergized with 2.40% piperonyl butoxide (CB-38 ExtraTM, Waterbury Companies Inc., Waterbury, CT) to kill the flies. Dead flies were removed from the chambers.\\nA portion of the NDV-exposed flies was held in reserve to determine NDV titers in whole flies. Immediately after placement of other NDV-exposed flies in Horsfal units, these flies were counted, pooled, homogenized, clarified by centrifugation, and NDV titers were determined as described above. Mean NDV titers per fly were determined by dividing the titer for pooled flies by total number of flies within the homogenate.\\nThe birds were observed daily for clinical signs of infection. At 3-d postexposure, tracheal swabs were collected from each of five birds in each group. Swabs were placed in 1 ml of DMEM, placed on ice, and stored at −70°C. Presence of NDV in tracheal swabs was determined by inoculation of chicken embryo fibroblasts as described above. Chicks were bled for NDV serology on day 21 and euthanatized.\\n\\nExperiment 4. Dose–response study to evaluate effect of dose and inoculation site for NDV (Roakin) infectivity. Fourteen-day-old chickens were divided into eight groups of 10 birds each and placed in separate Horsfall isolation units. Chicks were intranasally inoculated by squirting 100 μl containing a 102, 103, and 104 ID50 of NDV (Roakin) into the left nasal passage. Chicks were inoculated orally by passing a no. 5 French catheter into the crop and delivering 1.0 ml containing the calculated dose of 104, 106, and 108 infectious units NDV (Roakin). Two control groups of 10 birds were sham inoculated. Birds were observed daily for clinical signs of disease. At day 21 postexposure, blood was collected from six birds in each group; all birds then were humanely euthanatized. Serum was evaluated by hemagglutination inhibition assays for presence of NDV-specific antibodies. The experiment was conducted once.\\nAdult house flies harbored Newcastle Disease virus in both crop and gut tissues. Live NDV was detected in crops tissues of house flies for 96 h postfeeding in two of three replicated experiments (Table 1). In the one replicate, NDV was detectable at 24 h postexposure, but not at 96 h. Virus titers were greatest within 30 min of a single feeding of the flies. NDV titer decay was predictably time dependent from 0.5 to 24 h following the logistic model [y = −0.4306ln(x) + 2.0187; R2 = 0.7329] (Fig. 1). Virus titers would be expected to remain stable or increase if NDV survived or was replicated in the fly tissues. NDV was not detected in the tissues of sham-exposed flies collected at the same time intervals.\\nNDV was detected in the gut tissues of the house fly for 24 h postfeeding (Table 2. ) Titration of NDV in gut tissues at the 30-min interval was greater than that found in the crop tissues. The 24-h rate of decay in virus titer was time dependent in the gut tissues [y = −1.2677ln(x) + 4.3786; R2 = 0.914] (Fig. 1). Little virus as detected 9 h after the initial exposure to NDV. Virus was not detected in the tissues of sham-exposed flies collected at the same time intervals.\\nNDV-infected house flies were confined to isolation units containing 2-wk-old chicks. Attracted by the movement of the flies within the units, chicks readily consumed all but a few house flies within 24 h.\\nNo virus was isolated from tracheal swabs collected at 3 d postexposure (five birds per group examined); and at day 21, no NDV-specific antibodies were detected (six birds per group examined). NDV titer in pooled NDV-exposed flies was determined to be ≈3 × 104 ID50 per fly.\\nNDV Roakin was infectious to all chickens (100%) when introduced intranasally at doses >103 ID50 (Table 3). When NDV Roakin was administered to chickens by oral gavage, all chicks (100%) were seropositive when inoculated with 108 ID50 of virus. No chicks became infected when orally inoculated with 104 ID50 of virus.\\nThe house fly satisfies many requirements of an efficient vector: abundance, mobility, tendency to feed on manure, and ability to harbor pathogenic agents. The current study demonstrates the potential of the house fly to harbor NDV in the crop and gut tissues, and it confirms the findings of Milushev et al. (1977). Virus was detectible in the fly crop for 96 h after a single feeding event. Virus titers in pooled fly crops ranged from 103 ID50 measured within 30 min of feeding on NDV inoculum to <101 ID50 at 96 h. Although NDV titers in pooled mid- and hindgut tissues were higher (107 ID50/0.2 ml) immediately after a single feeding, live virus was only detectable for 24 h. The starting NDV dose was ≈107 ID50 for both experiment 1 and 2. It is interesting that the crop had much less virus at 30 min than the gut, suggesting that the flies directed a significant portion of the virus containing medium directly to the gut in response to periods of food deprivation. In a previous study, we found turkey coronavirus (family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus, TCV) remained active in the crop of the house fly for 9 h, but it was inactivated in the gut (Calibeo-Hayes et al. 2003). It is likely that midgut proteolytic enzymes inactivate NDV within 24 h and similar enzymes are not present in the crop where the virus may be active longer. As with TCV, the current study indicates that the house fly is a mechanical vector of NDV. The decrease in virus titers indicates that the house fly is not a propagative vector of NDV.\\nPresumably, the potential of the house fly to transmit a disease agent is enhanced by the relative abundance of the vector. In our study, flies were released in isolation units at rates of 10, 100, and 250 flies per unit, simulating conditions that may be found in the field. Although the chicks were observed eating flies that each carried ≈3 × 104 ID50 virus, none of the susceptible chicks became infected. These findings suggested a possible dose effect.\\nSubsequent experimentation to establish an infectious dose necessary for oral exposure indicated that NDV Roakin, when administered by oral gavage at 104 ID50 of virus, was insufficient to cause infection (Table 3); only those birds inoculated with a dose ≥106 ID50 became infected. These findings suggest that NDV transmission, in the current study, failed because chicks failed to ingest an adequate quantity of virus-laden flies; based on calculations chicks would have needed to consume >33 flies to reach a sufficient dose for infection by the oral route. However, intranasal inoculation at 104 ID50 infected 100% of the chicks. Although the house fly did not transmit NDV in our study, the potential to mechanically transmit NDV remains a possibility because NDV was detectable in both crop and gut tissues for up to 96 and 24 h, respectively, postfeeding (Tables 1 and 2).\\nNewcastle disease outbreaks vary significantly in virulence, transmissibility, and persistence (Feener et al. 1993, Kinde et al. 2004). Velogenic forms of the virus are most virulent and cause the greatest mortality, whereas virulent mesogenic forms may cause mortality, and lentogenic forms are generally nonfatal. Live vaccines are usually developed from lentogenic and mesogenic strains and include Mukteswar (mesogenic), Roakin (mesogenic), and La Sota (lentogenic), among others (Alexander 1991). Accordingly, lentogenic vaccines may be administered intranasally and mesogenic vaccines intramuscularly. As with field strains of avian viruses, the virulence of NDV viruses may have bearing on vector competency studies, and virulent velogenic ND may be more amenable to fly transmission at lower doses.\\nIn our study, NDV Roakin was infectious at a dose of 103 ID50 after 100-μl intranasal inoculation. Under epizootic conditions, NDV replicates in the upper respiratory and intestinal tract of the avian host (Feener et al. 1993). Respiratory tract receptor sites may be the initial foci for NDV attachment and becoming systemic as virus spreads to other target organs. Respiratory tract inoculation by house flies is not likely to occur.\\nIn summary, after a single feeding, the house fly harbored live NDV Roakin in both crop and gut tissues 96 and 24 h, respectively. NDV did not replicate in fly crop or digestive tract tissues. Mechanical transmission of NDV by the house fly was not demonstrated in the current study. In controlled experiments, NDV-exposed house flies did not transmit NDV even though each fly carried ≈104 ID50 of virus when placed in contact with susceptible chickens. This was unexpected, because NDV-exposed flies were eaten by contact chickens soon after placement in isolation units. However, subsequent experiments demonstrated a dose effect for NDV Roakin: an ID50 ≥106 was required to infect chickens by the oral route, the likely route of transmission for NDV by flies. These studies indicate that at least for NDV Roakin, house flies did not carry sufficient quantities of virus to infect chickens and are unlikely vectors. Additional studies using other NDV strains, particularly velogenic strains, are needed to definitively determine the role of house flies as vectors of NDV.   \n",
              "1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Live attenuated viruses have been developed and used to help protect humans from various infectious diseases. Live attenuated vaccine viruses simulate natural infection and are highly immunogenic and effective in inducing both humoral and cellular immune responses. Because of their demonstrated safety and effectiveness against infectious diseases, different live attenuated vaccine viruses have been explored as vectors to express heterologous antigens [1]. Measles vaccine (MV) strain has a long history of demonstrated safety in humans. It induces long lasting immunity including antibody and T cell responses [2-4]. Aerosol administration of measles vaccine is also being developed and has been shown to induce similar or better immunogenicity compared to conventional subcutaneous or intramuscular vaccination [5, 6]. This aerosol administration route may offer advantages in helping to protect individuals from mucosal pathogens.\\nThe development of reverse genetics for negative stranded RNA viruses including measles virus has made it possible to explore the utility of the negative stranded RNA viruses to deliver foreign antigens. Measles vaccine virus has been explored by several laboratories to express foreign antigens such as the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS coronavirus, HIV gp160, HPV L1 and hepatitis B surface antigens [7-10]. The vectored MV induces robust antibody and T cell responses against both insert antigens and MV [7-18], making it an attractive option for vaccination against measles as well as other infectious agents. Although some studies showed that MV could boost measles virus immune response in school aged children who had previously received measles vaccine [19, 20], the pre-existing immunity to measles virus may reduce the immunogenicity of the vectored measles vaccine [21, 22]. Thus, the utility of MV vector in measles seropositive population remains to be determined. Several studies performed in the early 1980s in developing countries revealed that high seroconversion rates were achieved with EZ measles vaccine despite the presence of high titer of maternal measles virus antibody [23]. Therefore, the EZ strain might be immunogenic in populations with histories of measles vaccination or preexisting MV immunity.\\nIn this study, we explored the use of the EZ vaccine strain to deliver viral antigens for prevention of RSV and EBV associated diseases. RSV causes severe lower respiratory tract illness in infants and the elderly. Bronchiolitis from RSV infection in infants is associated with recurrent wheezing and asthma in childhood [24]. No vaccine is available to prevent morbidity and mortality from RSV infection. The surface fusion (F) protein of RSV is a major antigenic protein that induces neutralizing antibodies, CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and protection against subsequent RSV challenge in mice or cotton rats [25]. High levels of F neutralizing antibodies are sufficient to protect the lower respiratory tract infection [26] and have been used for prophylactic purpose in infants.\\nEBV is a gamma herpes virus that causes infectious mononucleosis in adolescents [27]. In addition, EBV has been associated with certain malignancies including Burkitt’s lymphoma, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease, lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma [28]. There is no prophylactic EBV vaccine available. The surface glycoprotein gp350, which binds to human CD21 receptor on B cells to mediate viral entry, has been identified as a protective antigen. The adjuvanted EBV gp350 protein has been shown to be efficacious in a randomized phase II study in preventing infectious mononucleosis [29]. Here, we report the construction of an infectious measles virus by reverse genetics system and the insertion of the F protein of respiratory syncytial virus or gp350 of EBV into MV virus as a separate transcriptional unit. The vectored viruses were then evaluated in cotton rats and rhesus macaques for their immunogenicity.\\nRSV A2 strain was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, MA). EZ vaccine strain was from Serum Institute of India (Pune, India). Vero and HEp-2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagles’s medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2mM L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C with 5% CO2.\\nAntigenomic cDNA was synthesized by DNA2.0 (Menlo Park, CA) based on the sequence of live attenuated measles virus Edmonston-Zagreb strain (NCBI DNA accession number F266290). The T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence was added to the 5’ end of the antigenomic cDNA and the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme and a T7 RNA polymerase terminator sequences were added to the 3’ end of the antigenomic cDNA. Sequence at nucleotides 5502 (Sca I) and 9343 (Mlu I) was modified to facilitate cDNA cloning. The three amino acid residues at positions 3682, 3862 and 10555 (3682K→R, 3862S→N, 10555K→R) that were different from the EZ vaccine strains were corrected by site-directed mutagenesis. The MV antigenomic cDNA was cloned into pUC18 vector and denoted as pEZ (Fig. 1). Supporting plasmids encoding measles N, P and L genes were cloned into pCITE plasmids under the control of T7 promoter as previously described and were designed pN, pP and pL respectively [30].\\nThe ectodomain of RSV F and EBV gp350 ectodomains were inserted into the non-coding region 3' proximal of the N gene or in the junction between the P and M genes of pEZ (Fig. 1). Each inserted gene contained measles virus transcriptional unit consisting of the sequences of N gene stop (GE-N) and P gene start (GS-P). To insert the RSV F gene into the promoter proximal location, a pUC-SnaBI/SacII (pUC-S/S) subclone that contained the T7 promoter and MV sequence of 1 to 2044 with a silent mutation at nt 821 to knockout EcoRV enzyme site was generated. A gene cassette containing the ectodomain of RSV-F (aa 1-524) followed by GE-N and GS-P sequence were inserted into EcoRV site at nt 99. The genomic DNA was in multiples of 6 nucleotides (the rule of six). The SnaB I-Sac II fragment was swiped back to pEZ antigenomic cDNA (Fig. 1A) and the resulting cDNA was denoted as pEZ-RSVsF1.\\nTo insert the RSV F gene and EBV gp350 gene into pEZ between the P and M genes, a pUC-SacII/NarI (pUC-S/N) subclone that contained the MV sequence of 2045 nt to 4924 nt was constructed. A gene cassette containing gene end (GE) of N, gene start (GS) of P and ectodomain of RSV-F (aa 1-524), full length (aa 1 -861) or truncated (aa 1-470) ectodomain of gp350 at SpeI site (nt 3372). The Sac II to Nar I fragment was swiped back to pEZ antigenomic cDNA (Fig. 1A) and the resulting cDNA was denoted as pEZ-RSVsF3, pEZ-EBVgp350 and pEZ-EBVgp350tr respectively.\\nRescue of the recombinant viruses from MV antigenomic cDNA was performed as previously described [16, 30, 31]. Briefly, HEp-2 cells were infected with MVA-T7 at a multiplicity of infectivity (moi) of 5 for an hour prior to transfection. A DNA mixture of pEZ (0.8 μg), pN (0.4 μg), pP (0.4 μg) and pL (0.2 μg) were co-transfected into MVA-T7 infected HEp-2 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The culture medium was replaced with DMEM containing 2% FBS after overnight incubation at 37oC. The transfected cells were incubated for an additional 3 to 4 days and the culture supernatant was used to infect fresh Vero cells to amplify the rescued virus. The rescued viruses were then plaque purified twice in Vero cells. The viruses rescued from pEZ, pEZ-RSVsF1, pEZ-RSVsF3, pEZ-EBVgp350 and pEZ-EBVgp350tr were designated as rEZ, sF1, sF3, gp350 and gp350tr, respectively.\\nReplication kinetics of rEZ, gp350, gp350tr, sF1 or sF3 viruses was compared in Vero cells. Vero cells in six-well plates were infected with each virus at a MOI of 0.01 in triplicates. After a 1 hour adsorption at room temperature, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with 2 mL of complete DMEM at 35oC with 5% CO2. Aliquots of culture supernatant were collected daily from each well for 7 days and stored at -80oC until virus titration. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay in Vero cells as previously described [32]. Replication kinetic was performed twice in triplicate and each supernatant sample was titered in duplicate.\\nVero cells were infected at a MOI of 3.0 with rEZ, gp350, gp350tr, sF1 or sF3 for 18 hours at 37°C. Culture supernatant and cells were harvested separately. The cells were scraped and pelleted for 10 sec at 6,000 rpm in microfuge tubes and lysed in lysis buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% [vol/vol] protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 8.0) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 10 min on ice. The resulting cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min.\\nProteins from culture supernatant or cell lysates were separated by electrophoresis and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. Viral proteins were detected with anti-measles nucleoprotein (clone 2D7, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal rabbit EBV gp350 [33] or monoclonal antibody against RSV F proteins (palivizumab, MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD) antibodies. Intensities of the bands were quantified by ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Relative intensity was determined by comparing pixel intensity of the band relative to the rEZ control.\\nSpecific-pathogen-free 6- to 8-week-old cotton rats were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). The animal study protocol was approved by MedImmune’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane by inhalation and vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) with 105 PFU of rEZ, gp350tr, gp350, sF1 or sF3 in a 200 μl inoculum volume. The control groups were inoculated intramuscularly (i.m) with PBS, 105 PFU of UV-inactivated sF3, or intransally (i.n) with 106 PFU of RSV A2 strain. The animals were boosted with the same dose of viruses 4 weeks later.\\nThe animals were observed for clinical signs daily and bled at 14-day intervals to measure antibody responses. Twenty-eight days after the second immunization, the cotton rats from measles virus vectored RSV vaccine groups were challenged with 106 PFU of RSV A2 strain i.n. The lungs were harvested on day 4 post-challenge and viral titers were determined by plaque assay.\\nAdult rhesus macaques aged 3-9 year-old were used for the immunogenicity study at Valley Biosystems (West Sacramento, CA). All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee at MedImmune and Valley Biosystems. Measles vaccine immunization history of the rhesus macaques was confirmed by neutralization assay prior to the study. A total of 16 rhesus macaques (8 measles virus seropositive, 8 naïve) were used in the study. Half of the animals (4 measles virus sero-positive, 4 naïve) received two doses of gp350 intramuscularly using 105 PFU/inoculation and the other half received two doses of sF3 at the same dose intramuscularly. The inoculations were performed at 4 week intervals. Blood was drawn from each animal every 14 days to assess immune responses. Animals were anesthetized with ketamine intramuscularly at each procedure. Clinical symptoms were monitored by veterinarians for the duration of the study.\\nEBV gp350- or RSV F-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed to determine the levels of gp350 or F protein-specific antibodies. Briefly, 100 ng of purified recombinant soluble EBV gp350 or RSV F protein expressed from mammalian cells was adsorbed onto Immulon 2B plates overnight in PBS at 4°C. The plate was blocked with 5% BSA in PBS. Serial dilutions of animal sera in PBS/1%BSA were added to the plate and incubated for an hour at room temperature. After washing, HRP-conjugated anti-cotton rat IgG (Immunology Consultants Laboratory, Newberg, OR) or anti-rhesus macaques IgG (Rockland Immunochemicals, Boyertown, PA) were added and incubated for 1 hour. Finally, the plate was developed with tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase substrate (KPL, Rockford, IL) and stopped with HCl. Absorbances of the samples were read at 450 nm and the titer for each sample was calculated by determining the dilution at which the absorbance reached 2 times over the reading of no serum control. The lower limits of detection were 3.3 log2 and 6.6 log2 for EBV gp350 ELISA and RSV F ELISA, respectively.\\nMeasles virus specific neutralizing antibodies were determined as described previously [34] in 96-well plates using Vero cells. Neutralizing antibody titer is defined as the highest dilution that inhibits 50% CPE. RSV specific neutralizing antibody was determined by the plaque reduction neutralization assay as described previously [35]. The lower limit of detection was 4.3 log2 and 3.0 log2 for MV microneutralization and RSV plaque reduction assays, respectively. EBV specific neutralizing antibody titer was determined by the method described by Sashihara et al.,[36].\\nELISpot assays were performed with spleens from vaccinated and control cotton rats 14 days after the second dose and peripheral blood mononucleocyte cells (PBMC) of rhesus monkeys 28 days after the second dose. Splenocytes were isolated as previously described [37]. Splenocytes were counted using Vi-Cell (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and Interleukin 4-secreting T cells were quantified in an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay using R&D DuoSet ELISA System for cotton rat IFN-γ and IL-4 antibodies (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) as previously described using 10 μg/mL of EBV gp350 or RSV F proteins for stimulation [38]. Spots were scanned and counted by ImmunoSpot spot Analyzer (Cellular Technology, Cleveland, OH). The numbers of IFN-γ or IL-4 secreting cells were expressed as the number cells per 106 cells.\\nGraphPad Prism software was used to analyze the data (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). All data were expressed as the mean and standard error. The data were also analyzed by Mann-Whitney rank sum test to compare data distribution between any two experimental groups. Titer comparison between viruses in replication kinetic experiment was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, assuming non-parametric distribution.\\nThe reverse genetics system for measles Edmonston-Zagreb (EZ) vaccine virus was established by transfecting \\nMV antigenomic plasmid pEZ together with pP, pN and pL into MVA-T7 infected HEp-2 cells to recover infectious EZ virus. To generate rEZ expressing RSV F or EBV gp350, the F ectodomain of RSV and EBV gp350 were cloned into the MV antigenomic cDNA (Fig. 1A). The F was cloned at the two positions of the viral genome: one proximal to the N gene (1st position) and the other between the P and M genes (3rd position). EBV gp350 ectodomain and its N-terminal half of the gp350 (amino acid 1-470, gp350tr) that encoded the receptor binding site to CD21 [39] were also cloned into the EZ genome at the 1st and 3rd positions. Recombinant EZ with RSV F, EBV gp350 and EBV gp350tr inserted at the 1st or 3rd position were generated. However, viruses with gp350 and gp350tr inserted at the 1st position replicated poorly in vitro and were not evaluated further. The rescued recombinant viruses expressing RSV F or EBV gp350 or gp350tr were designed as sF1 (F at the 1st position), sF3 (F at the 3rd position), gp350 and gp350tr (both at the 3rd position), respectively.\\nTo confirm that these recombinant measles viruses expressed the desired antigens, the expression of the inserts in infected Vero cells was examined by Western blotting analysis. In addition to MV N protein that was detected in infected cell lysate (Fig. 1B), RSV F and EBV gp350 were detected in the culture supernatant of the infected cells (Fig. 1B), indicating the production of secreted form of RSV F and EBVgp350 proteins from virus infected cells. The observation of lower MV N expression in Vero cells infected with sF1 compared to other viruses may be attributed to the insertion of RSV F proximal to the MV N gene, which moved the MV N gene to the 2nd position of the genome and reduced its mRNA transcript level. The relative expression of RSV F to MV N, however, was shown to be higher for sF1 compared to sF3. This is consistent with the observation that genes proximal to 3’ end of the genome are transcribed more abundantly than those downstream and more RSV F was produced from sF1 than sF3 per virion.\\nViral replication efficiency of these recombinant viruses was assessed by growth kinetics in Vero cells. Both recombinant EZ (rEZ) and EZ vaccine viruses grew to a peak titer of 7.9 log10 PFU/mL on day 5 (Fig. 3A). rEZ with either RSVF (Fig. 2A) or EBVgp350 (Fig. 2B) inserts had comparable growth kinetics but slightly lower (between 0.1-0.7 log10 lower) than rEZ. The peak titers between the viruses were not statistically different. sF3 had a faster growth kinetics and reached peak titer on day 3 instead of day 5. Therefore, insertion of RSV F or EBV gp350 into the genome of EZ did not significantly reduce viral growth in vitro.\\nCotton rats had previously been demonstrated to be semi-permissive to measles virus infection [40] and are the best available small animal model for MV infection. In addition, cotton rats are susceptible to RSV infection and have been used in the evaluation of RSV vaccines [41, 42] and anti-RSV antibody investigated for prophylactic application [43]. The ability of rEZ vectored vaccines to induce humoral responses to measles virus and RSV F or EBV gp350 protein were assessed in cotton rats. Cotton rats were immunized \\nwith two doses of rEZ viruses intramuscularly at 4 weeks interval. Sera were collected 4 weeks post dose 1 and 2 weeks post dose 2. Measles virus neutralizing antibodies (MV Ab) were induced rapidly after one dose administration, reaching titers of 6.3-8.7 log2. No significant differences in MV Ab titers were observed among the animals receiving sF1, sF3, gp350 or gp350tr compared to rEZ. The 2nd dose increased MV Ab titers by 2-4 folds (Table 1). The control animals vaccinated with UV-inactivated sF3 or RSV A2 virus did not have detectable MV Ab titer (data not shown).\\nRSV-specific antibody responses were measured by RSV F-specific ELISA and microneutralization assay. sF1 or sF3 induced RSV F-specific IgG antibody in the vaccinated cotton rats (about 15.5-15.9 log2 post dose 1 and 22.1-23.7 log2 post dose 2). The RSV F-specific IgG antibody titers were similar between the sF1 and sF3 vaccinated groups. RSV neutralizing antibody titers were also measured against RSV A2 strain. After the first dose, sF1 and sF3 induced RSV neutralizing Ab and titers were boosted to 7.5-log2 and 8.9-log2 after the second dose (Table 1). There was no statistical difference in antibody response between sF1 and sF3 vaccinated animals and those intranasally infected with 2 doses of RSV A2 strain (9.4 log2 ± 1.5, data not shown). Animals vaccinated with UV-inactivated sF3 did not have detectable RSV antibody (data not shown), indicating that virus immunogenicity was dependent on live virus infection.\\nEBV-specific antibody response was measured by EBV gp350-specific ELISA assay. EBV specific ELISA Ab response was detected after one dose administrations of gp350 or gp350tr; after the 2nd dose the titers reached 7.3 and 4.3 log2 for gp350 and gp350tr vaccinated animals, respectively (Table 1). Gp350 induced a significantly higher EBV gp350-specific IgG titer than gp350tr. EBV specific neutralizing antibody could not be detected by the EBV neutralization assay.\\nCell mediated immune response is important for viral clearance and may play an important role in vaccine mediated protective immune response [44]. RSV F-specific and EBV gp350-specific T cell responses in splenocytes were examined by IFN-γ and IL-4 ELISpot on day 7 post the 2nd dose. The frequencies of RSV F-specific IFN-γ secreting cells were statistically higher in sF3 vaccinated group (average 130 spots/106 splenocytes) compared to sF1 vaccinated (average 9 spots/106 splenocytes) or RSV A2-infected animals (average 45 spots/106 splenocytes) (Fig. 3A). The RSV F-specific IL-4 secreting cells were low, averaged about 20 spots/106 splenocytes for both sF1 and sF3 groups. Surprisingly, no RSV-specific IL-4 secreting cells detected in RSV A2-infected animals (Fig. 3C). Thus, sF3 and RSV induced a Th1-biased response based on the higher IFN-γ to IL-4 secreting cell ratio.\\nThe frequencies of EBV gp350-specific IFN-γ and IL-4 secreting cells for gp350 (average 23 spots and 15 spots/106 splenocytes for IFN-γ and IL-4 respectively) and gp350tr vaccinated groups (average 49 spots and 41 spots/106 splenocytes for IFN-γ and IL-4 respectively) were not statistically different, but were statistically higher than the PBS control group for the gp350tr group (Fig. 3B, D).\\nAnimal model is not available for assessing EBV vaccine induced protective immune response. Cotton rat is the best available small animal model to evaluate RSV vaccine induced protection against wt RSV challenge infection. To assess if the immune responses induced from sF1 and sF3 could provide protection against RSV A2 challenge, vaccinated cotton rats were challenged with RSV A2 intranasally and virus titers in the lungs were measured. Similar to RSV infected animals, sF1 or sF3 offered complete protection against RSV A2 challenge with viral titers in the lungs that was at least 4.5 log10 lower than the control animals. In contrast, cotton rats vaccinated with 105 PFU of UV-inactivated sF3 had viral titer similar to the PBS control group, indicating that viral replication is necessary for induction of protective immune response (Fig. 4).\\nRhesus macaques are fully permissive to measles virus infection and have been used for evaluation of measles vaccine and measles virus pathogenesis studies [45-47]. The ability of rEZ vectored RSV F and EBV gp350 to induce measles virus specific or F or gp350 specific immune responses was examined in this more permissive animal model. Since sF3 demonstrated better immunogenicity than sF1 in cotton rats, only sF3 was evaluated in measles virus seropositive (MV+) rhesus macaques that had prior measles vaccination and measles virus seronegative (MV-) rhesus macaques. No abnormal clinical signs were observed and serum chemistries were within the normal range in all monkeys throughout the study (data not shown). sF3 or gp350 vaccinated monkeys induced a similar level of MV neutralizing antibody in both MV- and MV+ monkeys. A second dose of vaccination with sF3 or gp350 increased MV neutralizing Ab titers by about 4-fold in all groups (Table 2). The Ab titer differences between the groups were not statistically significant.\\nAntibody responses to the inserted genes, however, were relatively low. sF3 inoculated animals had RSV F-specific IgG titer higher than the pre-vaccination level (titers were under the detection limit). F specific IgG Ab titers were 9.3 log2 and 8.8 log2 in MV+ and MV- groups after dose 1, respectively. After a second dose, three out of 4 animals in MV+ group had more than 4-fold increase in RSV F-specific IgG Ab titer but none of the animals in MV- group had 4-fold increase in Ab response (Fig. 5A). After two doses of vaccination, RSV neutralizing Ab titers in all groups were very low in both MV+ and MV- groups. Seven out of 8 animals had a detectable level of RSV neutralizing Ab. The RSV Nt Ab titers were not statistically different between the two groups (5.0 log2 for MV+ versus 4.5 log2 for MV- groups) (Table 2). Ab responses to EBV gp350 in the gp350 vaccinated monkeys were not detected at all time points. Similar to antibody responses, IFN-γ secreting cells in PBMC to measles viral antigens were significantly higher (~10-fold) than the responses to either RSV F or EBV gp350 (Fig. 5B) while PBMC, when stimulated with measles viral antigens, RSV F or EBV gp350, did not secrete any IL-4. Thus, compared to the cotton rat studies, rEZ vectored viruses were poorly immunogenic in the primate model.\\nReverse genetics has been developed for generating recombinant measles virus vectored vaccines encoding foreign antigens based on the Edmonston-Schwarz and AIK-C vaccine strain [15, 48]. The reverse genetic system described in this study was based on the EZ vaccine strain, which is used predominantly outside the US. The EZ strain might be immunogenic in population that has prior measles vaccine immunization [23]. The ectodomains of the RSV F and EBV gp350 glycoproteins instead of full length proteins were engineered to be expressed by EZ to avoid the incorporation of the foreign surface glycoproteins onto the measles virus envelope. The expression of heterologous membrane proteins on measles virus surface may alter the binding of measles to its natural receptors and thus change the tissue tropism of measles virus. We showed that both RSV F and EBV gp350 was expressed efficiently in vitro. However, rEZ vectored vaccines induced insert specific responses in cotton rats but poor responses in rhesus macaques although both cotton rats and rhesus macaques have previously been shown to be permissive to measles virus infection to various degrees [47, 49-51].\\nOne of the important determinants for inducing a robust immune response in vivo is the amount of the expressed antigen level and antigen presentation. We have evaluated the effect of the gene insertion location and antigen expression level because transcription of nonsegmented negative strand RNA viruses is obligatorily sequential [52]. The genes located at proximal to the 3’ promoter are produced more abundantly than the ones distal to the promoter [53]. Indeed, when RSV F was introduced 3’ proximally to the N gene, it produced 10 times more secreted RSV F protein than when inserted between the P and M junction (data not shown). In comparison, insertion of the gp350 of EBV at the 1st position of EZ significantly affected virus replication. Insertion of the EBV gp350 gene between the P and M genes had less effect on virus growth, similar to that shown for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (14). The gene insertion position affected immunogenicity of EZ vectored vaccines in cotton rats. rEZ encoding RSV F ectodomain induced antibody response against measles and RSV F. rEZ-sF3 induced MV specific antibody response comparable to rEZ and RSV specific Ab response comparable to those induced by intranasal RSV infection in cotton rats; it also induced cell mediated response as measured by IFN-γ ELISpot assay. Surprisingly, sF1 was inferior to sF3 in its ability to induce both RSV neutralizing antibody and RSV F-specific IFN-γ secreting T cell responses, suggesting that sF1 may be more attenuated than sF3 in vivo. Immune response is dependent on viral infectivity and the nature of the inserts. rEZ vectored EBV gp350 and gp350tr induced lower gp350 specific IgG Ab response and undetectable neutralizing antibody response in cotton rats.\\nThe cotton rats immunized with MV expressing RSV F were also challenged with wt RSV. After challenge, the number of IFN-γ secreting cells was higher than IL-4 secreting cells, which was consistent with a Th1-biased response (data not shown). RSV enhanced disease has been associated with FI-RSV vaccine [54, 55]. A chimeric parainfluenza virus vectored RSV F [35] did not cause enhanced disease in hamsters and has been proven to be safe in phase I clinical trial in seronegative children [56]. Recently, a report from another group has shown that measles virus vectored RSV F did not cause unusual pathology in cotton rats after RSV challenge, thus, the likelihood of the MV vector F to cause enhanced disease is very low [15].\\nSince cotton rats are partially permissive to MV, MV vectored vaccine was further evaluated in rhesus macaques. Rhesus macaque is fully permissive to measles virus infection and the infected monkeys develop symptoms similar to those experienced by humans, such as skin rash, fever and conjunctivitis [47]. This monkey model was used in the neurovirulence testing of MV vaccine [57]. In addition, since rhesus macaques could be infected with human measles virus, the breeding colony is commonly vaccinated with MV. This allowed us to examine the effect of prior vaccination on vectored measles and mimic our target populations that either have maternal antibodies or have measles vaccination history. rEZ and rEZ expressing gp350 and sF3 induced a good level of antibody response to measles virus irrespective of their sero-status to MV. The antibody response was slightly lower in magnitude than what were observed in the cotton rats as the dose per kg used in the rhesus was ~ 90 times lower than in cotton rats. The antibody response to the F and gp350 inserts was much lower in rhesus macaques. A previous report showed that two doses of MV-HIV gp140 at 5x106 TCID50 (25 times higher dose than our study) induced a robust Ab response towards HIV gp140 in monkeys [10]. However, three doses of 104 TCID50 (1/15 our dose) of MV vectored HBV surface antigen induced a very low response in monkeys [14]. Thus, the low humoral responses to the vectored inserts in rhesus macaques may be due to a lower dose used in this study.\\nMeasles vaccine virus has been shown to bind signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM; also known as CD150) on activated immune cells and CD46 [58], which is ubiquitously expressed on human cells. It is thought that virus infects the respiratory tract through SLAM on dendritic cells. In cotton rats, although human CD46 and CD150 homologs have not been reported [59], measles virus could replicate in the lungs of these animals after intranasal infection [40]. We have evaluated different routes of administration (both intranasal and intramuscular) of MV vectored RSV F in cotton rats and found that both inoculation routes offered protection against RSV challenge after immunization (data not shown). Rhesus macaques possess both CD46 and CD150 receptor homologs [60] and are susceptible to measles virus infection and develop diseases similar to humans. The difference in receptors between the two animal species may be able to explain why insertion of the insert into EZ strain have further attenuated viruses and reduced immunogenicity of the virus in rhesus macaques but not in cotton rats.\\nWe also examined replication of EZ vectored RSV F and EBV gp350 in vivo by using real time qRT-PCR since differential in growth kinetics of recombinant measles virus may explain the difference in antibody responses. However, we were not able to detect measles genomes in PBMC isolated from whole blood 24 hours post vaccination. This may be attributed to the low copies of measles virus circulating in the blood or the time point used to measure measles kinetics in vivo was not optimal. In conjunction, we have examined replication of EZ vectors in PBMC of rhesus macaques ex vivo to determine if insertion of the foreign gene affected replication of these viruses in PBMC. PHA-activated PBMC cells were infected with rMV at MOI of 1.0 and growth kinetics were determined for 7 days. The peak titer of the recombinant viruses containing RSV F or EBV gp350 were only 0.5 log10 lower than rEZ (data not shown), indicating the vectored vaccine could infect rhesus cells. We also investigated genetic stability of the insert by serially passaging the recombinant viruses in Vero cells 10 times and did not find the loss of the inserted gene expression as reported previously [61, 62].\\nOther negative stranded RNA viruses including Newcastle disease virus (NDV), vesicular stomatitis virus, Sendai virus and parainfluenza viruses [35, 63-65] had been evaluated as vectors to deliver foreign antigens and were shown to elicit both humoral and cellular responses in non-human primates and to confer protection to virus challenge in some cases [63, 66-69]. The vectored vaccines were normally delivered to non-human primates by either intranasal or intratracheal inoculation route. We found intranasal and intramuscular vaccination of EZ induced similar antibody response in cotton rats. It is possible that intranasal immunization might be more immunogenic than intramuscular vaccination in monkeys.\\nBased on our study, MV vector is probably not suitable for delivery of the EBV gp350 antigen. Immunogenicity of adjuvanted gp350 protein vaccine has been demonstrated in young adults [29], adjvanted gp350 might be the right approach for EBV vaccine development. The amount of gp350 delivered by MV is likely not sufficient to induce gp350 specific immune response. The F protein of RSV delivered by MV is more immunogenic than EBV gp350, however, additional evaluation of immunogenicity of MV-RSV F must be conduced before proceeding to testing this vaccine in humans.   \n",
              "2  Ebola virus (EBOV) and other members of the family Filoviridae of enveloped, negative-strand RNA viruses are associated with highly lethal disease for which no FDA-approved vaccines or treatments exist. Filovirus particles are characterized by a thread-like morphology, with infectious virions averaging 800 to 1,000 nm in length by 100 nm in diameter (1). The viral genome is encapsidated by several proteins, the nucleoprotein (NP), VP24, VP30, and VP35, to form the ribonucleocapsid, along with the L polymerase (2, 3). The VP40 matrix protein adds structural support through interfaces with the nucleocapsid and the viral envelope (4). Studding the viral membrane are metastable trimeric glycoprotein (GP) spikes composed of disulfide-linked heterodimers, the GP1 receptor-binding subunit, and the GP2 fusion subunit (5).\\nThe filovirus GP2 subunit is categorized as a class I viral fusion protein on the basis of its α-helical major domains or heptad repeat (HR) regions (6). The N-terminal HR of GP2 comprises segments that encircle GP1 along with the internal fusion loop, which packs against an adjacent GP1 monomer (7). For insertion into apposing host membranes, the fusion loop must be extricated from its position in prefusion spikes and presumably extended before GP2 refolds. The postfusion structure of GP2 trimers is marked by six-helix bundle (6HB) formation (8, 9), consistent with other class I viral fusion proteins (10), bringing the host and viral membranes into close proximity to lower the kinetic barriers to fusion. Hemifusion of the outer bilayer leaflets precedes formation of a full fusion pore for the cytoplasmic release of the viral genome.\\nLike other filoviruses, EBOV is capable of binding a variety of surface molecules, which contributes to its broad cellular tropism. C-type lectins and phosphatidylserine receptors have been implicated in attachment, though their roles in uptake have not been fully defined (11–14), and T-cell immunoglobulin domain-1 may act as a receptor on epithelial cells (15). Internalization of EBOV occurs primarily through a macropinocytosis-like process, and the virus traffics through the endocytic pathway (16–18). Proteolytic cleavage of GP1 by a class of low-pH-activated proteases, cysteine cathepsins, removes the C-terminal glycan cap and mucin domain sequences (19) to reveal a receptor-binding domain. This newly exposed GP1 domain interacts with Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), which serves as an obligate intracellular receptor for filoviruses (20, 21). While cathepsin cleavage and subsequent NPC1 binding are indispensable for infection, they are themselves insufficient to mediate release of the viral genome to the cytoplasm (22). A final trigger for fusion of viral and endosomal membranes by GP2 has been postulated but not demonstrated (23, 24), and which precise endosomal compartment actually supports fusion is unknown.\\nTo date, progress in defining the requirements for EBOV fusion triggering has been hampered by the lack of robust assays with true biological relevance. In order to examine GP triggering more fully, we have used a real-time microscopy assay for the detection of GP-mediated lipid mixing within cells. This assay further enables the events of GP triggering and lipid mixing to be uncoupled from full fusion and infection. In this report, we characterize GP-mediated lipid mixing and investigate host factors thought to be involved in the process. Our findings identify essential but distinct roles for cysteine cathepsins and NPC1 in EBOV GP fusion triggering.\\nFor evaluating EBOV GP triggering under biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions, we generated vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotypes, which provide a highly validated surrogate system for recapitulating filovirus entry (25, 26). To facilitate viral tracking in most experiments, virions were engineered to contain a fluorescent protein, monomeric NeonGreen (mNG), fused to the viral phosphoprotein (P) (27, 28). The heavily glycosylated mucin domain (Muc) of EBOV GP is dispensable for entry, and its deletion enhances viral attachment (29, 30). Accordingly, we primarily used VSV pseudotypes bearing mucin domain-deleted GP (GPΔMuc). To validate our viral preparations, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine (DiD)-labeled VSV bearing mNG-P and EBOV GPΔMuc was bound to a coverslip and incubated with Alexa Fluor 555-labeled KZ52, a neutralizing antibody that recognizes a conformational epitope at the GP1-GP2 interface (7). On average, over 90% of DiD-labeled particles also possessed NG-P signal, and 72% of total particles exhibited triple-labeling, indicating that the preparations used were of high quality (Fig. 1A).\\nThe lipophilic dye DiD spontaneously incorporates into membranes and displays fluorescence self-quenching at high concentrations. Lipid mixing between viral and host bilayers, as in hemifusion or fusion, enables lateral diffusion of the dye accompanied by dequenching or increased fluorescence intensity (31, 32). Virions were labeled so that the fluorescence signal of self-quenched DiD was detectable prior to dequenching. DiD dequenching resulted in a sharp increase in signal, which we define here as at least a doubling of DiD intensity within 20 s, and a net increase in intensity of 2- to 5-fold within 1 min was typically observed (Fig. 1B and C; see also Movie S1 in the supplemental material). In our experiments, increases in DiD signal sorted strictly into one of two groups: very fast or very slow. Fast dequenching, as indicated by a representative trace (Fig. 1D, solid line), occurred irrespective of nucleocapsid release (data not shown) and appears to indicate specifically triggered lipid mixing events. We attribute the significantly lower rate of DiD dequenching (Fig. 1D, dotted line) to nonspecific transfer of the dye to host membranes, possibly through particle degradation. Only fast events constituted “dequenching” in this study. We found that the extent of dequenching varied somewhat among DiD-labeled particles. This may reflect differences in the volumes of endocytic compartments, as well as in the concentration of dye within the viral membrane, as some heterogeneity in self-quenching was noted. Dequenching events occurring at later postinfection time points generally exhibited greater amplitude between the quenched and dequenched states (data not shown).\\nWe initially investigated dequenching kinetics in Vero cells, due to their high permissivity and established use in filovirus infection studies. The time span needed for 50% of particles bearing EBOV GPΔMuc to dequench (t1/2) was 42 min, considerably greater than the t1/2 of 17 min for similar particles bearing VSV G, which is believed to undergo fusion triggering in early endosomes (Fig. 2A) (33, 34). We found that the dequenching kinetics for VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc particles were very similar in U2OS cells (t1/2 = 44 min, Fig. 2B), and, because autofluorescence is much lower than in Vero cells, we used U2OS cells in the bulk of our experiments. Regardless of cell type, virtually all dequenching events occurred within 2 h of the synchronized onset of infection. We also examined the dequenching kinetics of VSV particles bearing full-length EBOV GP. Although the onset and conclusion of dequenching events showed similar timings, the overall rate of dequenching by VSV-EBOV GP (t1/2 = 64 min) was slower than that of VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc, which may reflect differences in internalization or the need for additional proteolytic processing (Fig. 2C). Precleavage of EBOV GPΔMuc by thermolysin, which structurally and functionally mimics the required cleavage of EBOV GP by endosomal/lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin B (19, 35), did not accelerate dequenching kinetics compared to uncleaved EBOV GPΔMuc.\\nLive imaging revealed that the majority of virions did not engage in lipid mixing (Fig. 2D). Of the total number of cell-associated VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc particles, approximately 16% dequenched in Vero cells and 10% in U2OS cells within 2 h. Additionally, 9.1% of particles bearing full-length EBOV GP dequenched in U2OS cells in the same time span. VSV G particles showed similarly low probabilities for lipid mixing in the two cell types. Although we are unable to distinguish definitively between bound and internalized virions, nearly all cell-associated particles had trafficked to perinuclear regions by the end of experiments (data not shown), leading us to believe that uptake levels are high with both EBOV GP and VSV G. The low percentage of particles with actual relevance to infection validates our single-particle approach to elucidating aspects of EBOV entry.\\nIn order to confirm that the observed dequenching events indeed represented GP-mediated lipid mixing, we first assessed dequenching in the presence of NH4Cl. Failure to acidify endosomes precludes GP activation and infection (36, 37), as low pH is required for cysteine cathepsin activity (38) and possibly for fusogenic conformational changes in GP (39, 40). We found nearly a complete reduction of VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc dequenching by NH4Cl treatment, which lends support to the observed lipid mixing being specifically GP mediated (Fig. 3A).\\nThe need for host cysteine cathepsin cleavage of EBOV GP in infection is well established (19, 35). Pan-cysteine cathepsin inhibitors, such as E-64d, prevent entry by filoviruses, which differ in their preference for cleavage by cathepsin B or L (19, 41). We found that E-64d treatment reduced EBOV GPΔMuc-mediated lipid mixing by more than 90%, while lipid mixing by VSV G-bearing particles was not similarly affected (Fig. 3B), demonstrating that a lack of cysteine cathepsin activity hinders downstream events in lipid mixing for EBOV GP.\\nAs neutralizing antibodies directed against the EBOV GP base, such as KZ52 (7, 42) or c4G7 and c2G4 in the ZMapp antibody cocktail (43–45), have been hypothesized to inhibit fusogenic structural rearrangement, we evaluated their effects on lipid mixing (Fig. 3C). Our results confirm that KZ52 and ZMapp treatments specifically render EBOV GP less able to engage in lipid mixing while leaving viral internalization and trafficking unaltered (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material). Preincubation of VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc with KZ52 resulted in inhibition of dequenching by 60% at 50 µg/ml and 85% at 100 µg/ml. ZMapp also had a concentration-dependent, if slightly more potent, effect on dequenching, with lipid mixing inhibited by 83% at 50 µg/ml and 91% at 100 µg/ml. Neither antibody treatment was able to abolish dequenching, even though the concentrations used were approximately 30-fold to 40-fold higher than the reported IC90 values for viral neutralization by KZ52, c2G4, and c4G7 individually (42, 45). This supports the idea of the existence of a significant barrier to fusion, with the number of unencumbered GP molecules needed for simple lipid mixing being much lower than the number needed to bring about membrane fusion and genome release. Collectively, our results signify that lipid mixing is the express product of GP triggering, which entails some degree of conformational change by proteolytically primed EBOV GP and which may lead to or encompass full fusion.\\nThe endosomal/lysosomal membrane protein NPC1, involved in cholesterol homeostasis, serves as an essential intracellular receptor for filovirus infection, with a cysteine cathepsin-cleaved form of GP directly recognizing the lumenal domain C of NPC1 (20–22, 46). Because the precise role of NPC1 in filovirus entry has not been fully defined, we evaluated lipid mixing in the absence of NPC1 (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). Dequenching of VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc particles was inhibited almost entirely in NPC1-deficient U2OS cells, whereas VSV G dequenching was unaffected, indicating that NPC1 expression is vital for EBOV fusion triggering (Fig. 4A).\\nMutations at the putative GP1-NPC1 interface have been previously demonstrated to reduce GP1-NPC1 interaction and greatly impair infectivity (22, 47, 48). Recent work has shown that proteolytic cleavage of GP1 exposes the NPC1-binding site, comprising a basic/polar crest overhanging a deep hydrophobic trough (65). We investigated entry by VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc particles bearing three mutations in the NPC1-binding site (T83M in the trough, K114E/K115E in the crest) that abolish GP1-NPC1 interaction and viral infectivity (65). Lipid mixing was reduced by 97% with this triple mutant (Fig. 4B). The inhibition of lipid mixing by VSV-EBOV GP in NPC1-deficient U2OS cells and by VSV-EBOV GP (T83M/K114E/K115E) in wild-type (wt) U2OS cells was not explained by altered delivery to endosomal/lysosomal compartments, since postinfection colocalization of viral particles and endocytic markers was not significantly reduced (see Fig. S1B in the supplemental material).\\nNPC1’s functionality as a cholesterol transporter may also have some bearing on EBOV entry, as GP-mediated lipid mixing is selectively inhibited by the cationic amphiphile U18666A (Fig. 4C), which induces an NPC1 disease phenotype marked by cholesterol accumulation within late endosomes and lysosomes (20, 49). GP1-NPC1 binding is not affected by U18666A (20, 24), but short-term U18666A treatments that do not cause substantial cholesterol accumulation (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material) nevertheless prevent EBOV entry (20), suggesting that this block is due to the drug’s specific effect on NPC1 rather than to the resulting increase in endosomal/lysosomal cholesterol levels. Taken together, our results provide direct evidence that NPC1 facilitates one or more early steps in EBOV membrane fusion.\\nColocalization of dequenching virions with fluorescently labeled endosomal markers was performed in order to elucidate the compartment in which EBOV GP-dependent membrane fusion is triggered (Fig. 5; see also Movies S2 to S5 in the supplemental material). Although a recent report suggested that EBOV fuses exclusively in compartments devoid of NPC1 (50), we found that all dequenching particles in NPC1-mNG-expressing cells colocalized with this marker at the time of dequenching (Fig. 5J; see also Movie S5). Additionally, the high percentage of dequenching particles colocalized with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Rab7 (98%) indicates the ubiquity of this protein in endosomes supporting GP triggering. Further evidence that EBOV must traffic to a suitably mature compartment for fusion was provided by inhibition of dequenching by the two-pore calcium channel (TPC)-blocking small molecule tetrandrine (Fig. 6). Tetrandrine, which may impair the activity of TPC in endocytic trafficking and heterotypic fusion of vesicles (51), was recently shown to inhibit EBOV infection in vitro and in vivo (50) and decreased GP-mediated lipid mixing in our assay by 95% at 10 µM.\\nWhile considerable lipid mixing also occurred in GFP-LAMP1+ vesicles (75%), we found, surprisingly, that a significant fraction of dequenching VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc particles (15%) colocalized with GFP-Rab5 puncta. Despite their slower rate of lipid mixing events (Fig. 2C), 10% of particles bearing full-length EBOV GP also dequenched in Rab5+ compartments (data not shown). Because Rab7 appears to be a nearly essential component of the EBOV fusion compartment, these Rab5+ vesicles are likely intermediate endosomes, suggesting that GP triggering can occur earlier in the endocytic pathway than commonly believed (20, 50, 52, 53). Our results also imply that some population of endosomes must display Rab5 and NPC1 concurrently, at least in the U2OS cell line used. We detected an average lag of 6 min (ranging from 40 s to more than 20 min) between colocalization of viral and NPC1 signals and dequenching, indicating that the occurrence of GP triggering is not immediate upon delivery to NPC1+ compartments (Fig. 5K).\\nTo examine the effect of fusion loop mutation on lipid mixing, we tested two previously published GP2 mutants (Fig. 7) (54, 55). Internalization and late endosomal delivery of VSV particles bearing these mutants did not differ significantly from VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc (see Fig. S1C in the supplemental material), indicating that their defects are specific to aspects of fusion. The GP (F535R) mutant, characterized as having impaired membrane binding and insertion capability (54), exhibited no defect in lipid mixing while being unable to support infection. Another fusion loop mutant, GP (L529A/I544A) (54), showed substantially decreased lipid mixing. The L529A/I544A mutation is believed to prevent formation of the hydrophobic fusion loop tip at low pH, with L529 and I544 creating a scaffold along with F535 (54, 55). While nonviable, the double mutant did effect low-level lipid mixing (Fig. 7), suggesting that even severely disrupted GP fusion loops retain some capacity for membrane insertion in cells.\\nIn order to separate possible requirements for cysteine cathepsins pre- and post-NPC1 binding, we evaluated lipid mixing by GP in various cleavage states in the presence and absence of E-64d. Thermolysin was used to generate particles either fully or partially lacking C-terminal GP1 sequences corresponding to the glycan cap and mucin domains (Fig. 8A). While increased infectivity of particles bearing cleaved GP has been reported (19, 30, 35), we did not observe this phenomenon or enhanced lipid mixing. When particles were bound to cells to the same extent, cleaved and uncleaved GP produced similar levels of lipid mixing and infection (Fig. 8B and C). Unexpectedly, we found that dequenching by particles with cleaved EBOV GP was much less susceptible to E-64d blockage and that the degree of lipid mixing correlated with the extent of GP cleavage (Fig. 8C). Fully cleaved GP exhibited slight hyperfusogenicity that was unaffected in the absence of cathepsin activity. The inability of precleavage to rescue infectivity in E-64d-treated cells (Fig. 8B), however, indicates that a specific requirement for cathepsins in fusion pore formation lies post-NPC1 binding.\\nMost previous attempts to characterize EBOV membrane fusion have relied on assessing delivery of viral content, such as luciferase or β-lactamase, through which GP triggering is inferred (24, 52, 56). While content delivery assays are useful in characterizing infection on a general scale, they have sizable limitations. For example, they cannot resolve the fates of individual particles or differentiate between hemifusion, incomplete fusion pore expansion, and no GP triggering at all. In order to examine GP fusion triggering directly, we have employed an assay for tracking real-time lipid mixing by single particles that revealed novel and significant aspects of the process.\\nWe found, unsurprisingly, that the majority of cell-associated particles did not advance to lipid mixing (Fig. 2D). The low probability of lipid mixing suggests that the results of previously published experiments utilizing bulk endocytosis may be misleading, with an inadvertent focus on nontriggered virions. This presents a particular obstacle in determining factors involved in EBOV GP fusion triggering or the compartment(s) in which triggering occurs.\\nThe interaction between cysteine cathepsin-primed GP1 and NPC1 has been previously shown to be vital for filovirus infection (22); however, the precise role of NPC1 in this process was unknown. Here, we used an NPC1-deficient cell line and a GP mutant unable to bind NPC1 to prove that the GP-NPC1 interaction, and not just virus-NPC1 colocalization, is indispensable for EBOV fusion triggering and lipid mixing (Fig. 3 and 4). We found that the appearance of NPC1 in virus-bearing endosomes always preceded GP triggering, though the time span between the two events varied (Fig. 5K), as also reported by Simmons and colleagues through a live-cell imaging assay with GP-pseudotyped retroviruses while the current article was in preparation (53). Mingo et al. proposed that delivery to NPC1+ vesicles represented a key rate-limiting step for EBOV fusion (52), but we found a lag ranging from 40 s to more than 20 min between virus-NPC1 colocalization and dequenching. It is unknown at present whether NPC1 binding directly promotes fusogenic conformational changes in GP or primes it for interaction with additional host factors. Therefore, while the lag may represent the span of time needed for the virus to bind NPC1 as its lumenal domains appear in the compartment, it may also signify a need for one or more host factors to act on GP prior to or following GP1-NPC1 interaction.\\nWe provide direct evidence that EBOV GP fusion triggering occurs in NPC1+/Rab7+ vesicles, which may, in fact, encompass a range of endosomal compartments. Previously thought to undergo triggering only quite late in the endocytic pathway (50, 53), EBOV GP could mediate lipid mixing in intermediate endosomes, as indicated by their Rab5 signal, in our live assays. Because the presence of NPC1 is an absolute requirement for dequenching in our assay, we infer that some population of Rab5+ vesicles must contain NPC1 in U2OS cells. Such colocalization is not impossible, as immunofluorescence and fractionation studies have shown that NPC1 localizes primarily, but not entirely, to late endosomes, lysosomes, and the trans-Golgi network (49); therefore, NPC1 levels in some intermediate endosomes may be sufficient to support GP triggering. However, it is unclear whether viral genome release from relatively immature endosomes can occur following GP fusion triggering. Indeed, Simmons et al. found no evidence for GP-mediated retroviral content release from Rab5+ compartments (53), raising the possibility that virions must traffic further in the endocytic pathway to encounter host factors at levels necessary for complete fusion and genome release.\\nPrevious work has revealed that a conformational epitope at the GP1-GP2 interface in the GP base is targeted by multiple neutralizing antibodies, including two of three components of the ZMapp therapeutic cocktail (7, 44, 45), leading to the hypothesis that this epitope is an “Achilles heel” for filoviruses. It was proposed on structural grounds that these base-binding antibodies potently neutralize by blocking fusogenic rearrangement and membrane insertion by GP2. Here, we provide the first direct evidence that neutralizing antibodies targeting the EBOV GP base inhibit viral fusion triggering (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, higher concentrations of neutralizing antibody were required to inhibit lipid mixing to the same extent as infection, but this may typify fusion by enveloped viruses. A recent study by Otterstrom et al. (57) examined the levels of antibody binding needed to inhibit influenza virus hemifusion. Using a pair of potent, broadly effective neutralizing antibodies, whose inhibitory profiles against influenza virus strains are very similar to those of KZ52 and ZMapp against filoviruses (58, 59), the authors showed that only high concentrations of these stem-binding antibodies were able to block the majority of hemifusion events. Although their assay (viral particles bound to a supported bilayer) differed from ours, their data strongly corroborate our results, with approximately 50 to 150 µg/ml of either anti-influenza virus antibody needed to reduce in vitro hemifusion by ~90%. The requirement for antibody concentrations beyond relevance to infection indicates a far lower threshold for lipid mixing than for full fusion and content release.\\nFurther highlighting the distinction between EBOV lipid mixing and fusion, we found that GP mutations that abrogated infectivity did not necessarily extend to lipid mixing (Fig. 7). Although the F535R mutation was shown to reduce the binding of GP2 ectodomains with liposomes (54), we noted that lipid mixing in live cells was unaffected. Additionally, a peptide corresponding to the fusion loop of the L529A/I544A GP mutant was unable to insert into model membranes or promote lipid mixing in a cell-free system (38). While we likewise found that the L529A/I544A double mutant could not support infection, lipid mixing activity within cells was significantly reduced but not completely inhibited, indicating that the amino acid sequence may behave differently in native GP and in an isolated peptide, much less in an in vitro system. Shallow insertion of the fusion loop may be sufficient to yield lipid mixing in cells, even while failing to interact with the target membrane extensively enough for progression to full fusion pore formation.\\nEntry by virions bearing precleaved EBOV GP remains sensitive to inhibitors of host cysteine cathepsin activity, suggesting the existence of an additional protease-dependent step in filovirus membrane fusion (19, 35, 60). Surprisingly, however, our experiments revealed that lipid mixing by cleaved GP was entirely unaffected by inhibition of host cysteine cathepsin activity, even as infectivity was ablated (as reported previously) (Fig. 8). The latter finding is in agreement with that of Simmons et al., who found no evidence of content release by retroviral particles bearing cleaved GP in E-64d-treated cells; however, they were unable to examine lipid mixing consistently in their assay (53).\\nOur findings suggest that, following GP-NPC1 binding, cysteine cathepsins are dispensable for GP fusion triggering and lipid mixing but play a critical role in the formation and/or expansion of fusion pores that allow cytoplasmic release of viral genomes. We advance two mechanistic scenarios to account for our observations. First, the fusion trigger (comprising NPC1 and possibly an additional signal, e.g., acid pH, but not cysteine cathepsins) releases GP from its prefusion conformation, allowing formation of a membrane-bound prehairpin intermediate and driving hemifusion of viral and cellular membranes. A final cysteine cathepsin cleavage event then enables GP refolding to a 6HB, which mediates fusion pore formation and genome release. A similar two-step mechanism, with sequential roles for receptor binding and low pH, has been proposed for fusion by the avian sarcoma/leukosis retrovirus (61). Alternatively, it is conceivable that proteolytic cleavage of NPC1-bound GP is indeed the fusion trigger but that GP fusion triggering and 6HB formation can nevertheless occur inefficiently in the absence of cysteine cathepsin activity. Rearrangement of a few GP trimers may permit lipid mixing but not energetically costly fusion pore formation and expansion.\\nWhile this initial study focused primarily on the GP triggering and lipid mixing steps of EBOV entry, further work is needed to elucidate outstanding issues, such as the precise mechanism that explains why post-NPC1-binding cathepsin activity is required for infection but not lipid mixing. Future live-cell studies will examine the dynamics of fusion pore expansion and viral genome release and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the EBOV entry process.\\nU2OS human osteosarcoma cells were cultured in McCoy’s 5a medium (Gibco), and Vero grivet monkey kidney cells and human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (Gibco). All culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin.\\nGeneration of U2OS NPC1-ko cells was carried out by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing (62) using previously described methods (26). Briefly, a CRISPR guide RNA (gRNA) cloning vector (Addgene plasmid 41824) encoding an NPC1-specific gRNA that targets nucleotides 768 to 790 (5′ GGCCTTGTCATTACTTGAGGGGG 3′ on the complementary strand) of human NPC1 mRNA was cotransfected along with a plasmid encoding human-codon-optimized endonuclease Cas9 (Addgene plasmid 41815), a red fluorescent protein expression plasmid (to monitor transfection efficiency), and pMX-IRES-Bla (conferring blasticidin resistance to transfected cells). Following selection of transfected cells by blasticidin treatment, genomic DNA flanking the gRNA target site was amplified by PCR using forward (5′ TCATAAACACACCAAACTTGGAATC 3′) and reverse (5′ TCCTGCGGCAGAGGTTTTC 3′) primers and tested for indels by Surveyor assay as previously described (26). Once genome editing was confirmed at the population level, multiple single-cell clones were isolated for NPC1 gene sequencing. A clonal cell line, NPC1-#6, was found to contain a deletion of 13 nucleotides in both of its NPC1 alleles. The deletion in NPC1-#6 cells is predicted to cause a frame shift at amino acid position 167 that leads to production of a truncated protein of 215 amino acids, in comparison to the 1,278 amino acids of wild-type NPC1. We confirmed the absence of any remaining wild-type NPC1 alleles by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using NPC1-F (5′ AGGCCCCCTCAAGTAATGAC 3′, specific for the deleted sequence in the NPC1-knockout cell line) and npc1-R (5′ GCCCAAAGTGCTGGTCAAAG 3′) primers. Amplification of the site-1 protease (S1P) gene using S1P-F (5′ GATGTGCTCTGGCAGATGGG 3′) and S1P-R (5′ TTTCACGCCAGAACCCCGC 3′) primers was used as a positive control for RT-PCR.\\nPseudotyped virions were generated by infecting 293T cells expressing viral glycoproteins with VSV lacking its G gene, as previously described (19, 26, 28). GP cDNA derived from EBOV/H.sap/COD/76/Yam-Mayinga (EBOV “Mayinga” isolate) was used to generate VSV-EBOV GP. EBOV GPΔMuc lacks GP residues 309 to 489 (29). All EBOV GP mutants were generated in the GPΔMuc background. Infection supernatants were collected upon observation of significant cytopathy (1 to 4 days postinfection). Clarified supernatants were centrifuged at 4°C and 70,000 × g using an SW28 rotor to pellet the virus. Viral pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and further purified through a 10% sucrose cushion at 4°C and 107,000 × g using an SW41 rotor. Pellets were then resuspended in PBS at an approximate viral protein concentration of 1 mg/ml, and aliquots were stored at −80°C until use. Viral infectivity was assessed as previously described (19).\\nCleavage of EBOV-GP was performed by incubating the virus with 250 µg/ml thermolysin (Sigma) for 1 h for partially cleaved GP and 500 µg/ml thermolysin for 2 h for fully cleaved GP at 37°C after the first ultracentrifugation step. Protease activity was quenched by addition of 1 mM phosphoramidon (Peptides International) and incubation on ice for 20 min prior to the second ultracentrifugation step through a sucrose cushion. The extent of cleavage was confirmed by immunoblotting with an anti-GP1 antibody.\\nViral membranes were labeled with self-quenching concentrations of DiD (Life Technologies). Virus (50 µg) was incubated with 250 µM DiD for 90 min with gentle agitation in the dark at room temperature. Labeled virus was passed through a NAP-5 column (GE Healthcare) to remove excess dye and large aggregates and was used for imaging within 48 h. DiD labeling reduced viral infectivity by less than 10% (data not shown).\\nZMapp was a gift from John Dye (USAMRIID). For production of KZ52, various heavy- and light-chain domains of KZ52 were chemically synthesized as codon-optimized sequences for expression in human cells by Epoch Life Sciences and cloned into pMAZ-IgH (containing the expression cassette of human γ1 chain constant domains) and pMAZ-IgL (containing the expression cassette of human κ light-chain constant domains) vectors (63), respectively, using a Gibson assembly kit (New England Biolabs). Sanger sequencing confirmed the identity of the cloned vectors. Antibody production and purification were carried out as described earlier (64), with modifications. Briefly, suspension-adapted HEK293-Freestyle cells–grown in suspension cultures in Freestyle F17 expression media (Thermo Scientific)–were cotransfected with pMAZ-IgH-KZ52 and pMAZ-IgL-KZ52 (1:1 ratio) vectors using polyethyleneimine. At 6 to 7 days posttransfection, the supernatant was collected and incubated overnight at 4°C with protein A agarose resin (GenScript Corporation) in the presence of cOmplete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Life Sciences). After the resin was washed with PBS (pH 8.0), bound IgG was eluted with 100 mM glycine (pH 3.0) into 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The eluate was concentrated and buffer exchanged with PBS by use of an Amicon centrifugal filter concentrator (Millipore) with a molecular weight cutoff of 30,000 Da. Purified antibody was stored at −20°C. Protein concentration and yield were determined by UV absorbance, and purity was determined by SDS-PAGE. For labeling coverslip-bound virus, KZ52 was conjugated with Zenon Alexa Fluor 555 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\\nStock solutions of drugs were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or water and stored as frozen aliquots until use. Cells were incubated with ammonium chloride (Sigma) for 15 min or with E-64d (Peptides International) and tetrandrine (Sigma) for 1 h prior to experiments performed at the indicated concentrations. No preincubation with U18666A (Calbiochem) was performed. Inhibitors were maintained at the same concentrations during spinoculation and imaging.\\nFor expression of fluorescently labeled endocytic pathway markers, cells were transduced with CellLight vectors (Life Technologies) for early endosomes (GFP-Rab5), late endosomes (GFP-Rab7), or lysosomes (GFP-LAMP1) 18 h prior to imaging according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A retroviral packaging vector bearing NPC1-mNG was also generated, and cells were transduced 18 h in advance of imaging.\\nLive imaging was performed on a DeltaVision widefield epifluorescence microscope (GE Healthcare) at 37°C. The microscope was equipped with a heated environmental chamber, an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) camera (Photometrics), a 40×/1.35 numerical-aperture (NA) oil immersion objective, and a DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)/fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/tetramethyl rhodamine isocyanate (TRITC)/Cy5 filter set.\\nCells were seeded on fibronectin-coated 35-mm-diameter coverslip dishes (MatTek) 24 h in advance of experiments and were grown to approximately 70% confluence. Dishes were placed on ice for several minutes before addition of virus. Virus in imaging buffer (140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose, 2 µg/ml Hoechst stain, and 2% FBS, pH 7.4) was spinoculated onto cells by 20 min of centrifugation at 1,500 × g at 4°C. Inoculum volumes were adjusted so that 200 to 400 cell-associated particles were visible per field. Unbound particles were removed by four washes with cold PBS, and 500 µl cold imaging buffer was added to the dish. Samples were mounted on the microscope and quickly focused, and then 1.5 ml warm imaging buffer was added to start the experiment (t = 0). Images were acquired every 4 s over the duration of the experiments using a single Z-section, as the cells were very flat. Excluding the initial kinetics studies, all experiments were limited to 2 h.\\nImage analysis and single-particle tracking were performed using Volocity software (PerkinElmer). Excluding minor adjustments in brightness and contrast, image files were not manipulated. For single-particle dequenching measurements, puncta were thresholded by initial intensity and size. Puncta falling outside the range of 0.125 to 1.0 µm2 expected of discrete VSV particles were excluded from analysis.\\nFor colocalization of dequenching particles with cellular markers, a virion was considered colocalized only if the GFP or mNG punctum exceeded the cellular background signal by 30% or more and if the GFP or mNG and DiD puncta cotrafficked (greater than 80% overlap of DiD signal with GFP or mNG signal) for at least 20 s before and after a dequenching event. The majority of colocalized dequenching events far exceeded these criteria.\\nMean measurements (± standard deviations [SD]) were derived from three separate experiments, unless otherwise indicated. Statistical significance was established by Student’s t test or by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a post hoc Dunnett’s test (**, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ****, P < 0.0001).   \n",

Healthcare workers (HCWs) in China's National TB Control Programme have a significantly increased level of exposure to TB disease and patients. After the severe acute respiratory syndrome pandemic in 2003, the Chinese government made increased efforts to protect HCWs from nosocomial TB infections and other respiratory infectious diseases, especially for those HCWs working in chest hospitals and infectious disease hospitals. These efforts (although not universal throughout China) included the increased use of biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratories and respiratory isolation through negative pressure wards and rooms, and the practice of standardised biosafety protocols and procedures through continued training and education.\\nSystematic TB screening in HCWs can improve their awareness of TB infection [2]. The tuberculin skin test (TST) has been widely used for the detection of TB infection for decades but due to cross-reactivity with the bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination and exposure to non-TB mycobacteria, the TST fails to provide sufficient specificity for the detection of TB infection [2]. In the past decade, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) release assays have been developed and commercialised to measure the in vitro release of IFN-γ from effector T-cells stimulated with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigens (the 6-kDa early secretory antigenic target and 10-kDa culture filtrate protein) as an aid to diagnosing TB infection. These new screening assays (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands) and T-SPOT.TB (Oxford Immunotec, Abingdon, UK)) have demonstrated higher specificity and at least comparable sensitivity for the diagnosis of TB infection compared with the TST [3].\\nThe goal of the present study was to investigate and describe latent TB infection (LTBI) among HCWs in China, and the effectiveness of infection control strategies in TB hospitals using the T-SPOT.TB assay and TST. This study was conducted in two major primary referral hospitals for TB patients and other respiratory infectious diseases in Shandong Province, China, in 2013: the Shandong Provincial Chest Hospital (SPCH), Jinan; and Linyi Municipal Chest Hospital (LMCH), Linyi. Approximately 3000 patients with active TB disease are treated in each hospital annually. Since 2004, both hospitals have been equipped with BSL3 laboratories that are used for mycobacterial specimen testing (acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear test, culture and species identification) and respiratory isolation wards with negative pressure rooms for smear-positive TB patients. As recommended by China's National Tuberculosis Control Programme, the TST was carried out by the Mantoux method using a 5 tuberculin unit dose of BCG purified protein derivative (Chengdu Institute of Biological Products, Chengdu, China). An induration of ≥10 mm was defined as a positive TST. A blood sample for the T-SPOT.TB assay was drawn from each HCW before the TST was performed. T-SPOT.TB assays were carried out and interpreted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Spot counts were analysed using an ELISPOT reader (CTL-ImmunoSpot S5 Core Analyzer; Cellular Technology Ltd, Shaker Heights, OH, USA). Covariates (age, sex, working year and job category) associated with positive T-SPOT.TB results were analysed by univariate and multivariate analyses. Univariate p-values were determined for each covariate by logistic regression. Covariates with univariate p-values <0.20 were included in multivariate logistic regression models. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata/SE version 13.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of SPCH and LMCH.\\n1141 HCWs (median age 35 years, range 19–70 years; physicians 18.1%, nurses 42.3%, laboratory staff 4.3%, medical technicians 10.9%, hospital logistic staff 12.7%, administrative staff 11.7%) out of 1334 total employees of both hospitals were enrolled and screened for TB infection in this study, after 66 were excluded due to age <18 years, pregnancy, tuberculin allergy or past TB disease history, and 127 refused to participate (figure 1). 935 (82.9%) out of 1141 HCWs had BCG vaccination scars and 1071 (94.0%) reported having been exposured to active TB. Of 1141 HCW participants, 70 (6.1%) were only given the T-SPOT.TB assay, 186 (16.3%) received the TST alone and six had an indeterminate or failed T-SPOT.TB assay (figure 1). A total of 879 HCWs (median age 34 years, mean age 35.8 years; range 19–70 years) had both TST and T-SPOT.TB results available for analysis. The overall positivity rate of T-SPOT.TB testing was 13.9% (122 out of 879; 95% CI 11.7–16.3%), while the TST positivity rate was 49.3% (433 out of 879; 95% CI 45.9–52.5%). The agreement between TST and T-SPOT.TB test results was 51.9% (95% CI 48.6–55.2%; κ=0.027).\\n\\nResults for univariate analysis showed that T-SPOT.TB positivity was only associated with older age and longer duration of healthcare service. In multivariate models that included both subject age and longer duration of healthcare service, only duration of healthcare service remained significantly associated with positive test results. Specifically, subjects with >10 years of service had the highest odds of a positive test result (univariate OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.53–3.31; >10 years versus ≤10 years of service).\\nOur data suggests that the highly specific T-SPOT.TB assay had a significantly lower rate of positivity among HCWs at the SPCH and LMCH than the TST and when compared with other hospital-based studies in Beijing, China (13.9% versus 33.6% at Beijing Chest Hospital (BCH) and 28.6% in a tertiary general hospital in Beijing) [4, 5]. Compared to the data from BCH, both study HCW populations (SPCH/LMCH versus BCH) share similarities in distribution of age and sex and occupational levels of exposure to M. tuberculosis. In addition, data from the 2011 Chinese National TB Surveillance Summary suggest the reported prevalence of TB disease in Shandong Province (SPCH/LMCH) and Beijing (BCH) are also similar at 15–44 cases per 100 000 population [6]. Thus, the only major discernible difference between SPCH/LMCH and BCH is the lack of an ISO15189-certified TB reference laboratory and respiratory isolation wards with negative pressure rooms for AFB smear-positive TB patients at the BCH. In conclusion, a proactive and comprehensive strategy for nosocomial infection control practices plays a pivotal role in protecting HCWs from TB infection, which should be implemented in all chest hospital and infectious disease settings in China.\\nThe importance of effective measures against nosocomial TB infection has been clearly emphasised by the World Health Organization Stop TB strategy and recent Policy on Infection Control [7]. Towards the goal of TB elimination, prevention and treatment of LTBI are essential elements of global TB control efforts [8–10]. HCWs working in clinical facilities managing TB patients are definitely at the top of high-risk populations of LTBI and TB, and need effective occupational health protection.   \n",

                  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread with unprecedented speed and scale since the first zoonotic event that introduced the causative virus-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-into humans, probably during November, 2019, according to phylogenetic analyses suggesting the most recent common ancestor of the sequenced genomes emerged between Oct 23, and Dec 16, 2019. 1 The reported cumulative number of confirmed patients worldwide already exceeds 70 000 in almost 30 countries and territories as of Feb 19, 2020, although that the actual number of infections is likely to far outnumber this case count. 2, 3 During any novel emerging epidemic, let alone one with such magnitude and speed of global spread, a first task is to put together a line list of suspected, probable, and confirmed individuals on the basis of working criteria of the respective case definitions. This line list would allow for quick preliminary assessment of epidemic growth and potential for spread, evidence-based determination of the period of quarantine and isolation, and monitoring of efficiency of detection of potential cases. Frequent refreshing of the line list would further enable real-time updates as more clinical, epidemiological, and virological (including genetic) knowledge become available as the outbreak progresses.\\nTherefore, from a public health viewpoint, a line list is indispensable. Hence, Kaiyuan Sun and colleagues' work, 6 published in The Lancet Digital Health, is very valuable at this key timepoint in the COVID-19 outbreak. Sun and colleagues harnessed Chinese social media, specifically a social network used by healthcare professionals, to compile individual-level data on patients with COVID-19 and daily province-level case counts during January, 2020. They distilled this information into a crowdsourced line list, which, when analysed appropriately, aligns closely with that derived from official versions, such as the report published by the Chinese CDC on Jan 29, 2020. 7 For instance, the various delay intervals converge between the first 425 cases in Wuhan in the earlier report 7 and the 507 cases sourced from both China and overseas in the present Article. Although Sun and colleagues' work provides a valuable picture of the outbreak in real time, the geographical coverage is heterogeneous with only a small proportion of cases from the epicenter of Wuhan and Hubei province.\\nWe surveyed different and varied sources of possible line lists for COVID-19 (appendix pp 1-4). A bottleneck remains in carefully collating as much relevant data as possible, sifting through and verifying these data, extracting intelligence to forecast and inform outbreak strategies, and thereafter repeating this process in iterative cycles to monitor and evaluate progress. A possible methodological breakthrough would be to develop and validate algorithms for automated bots to search through cyberspaces of all sorts, by text mining and natural language processing (in languages not limited to English) to expedite these processes.\\nIn this era of smartphone and their accompanying applications, the authorities are required to combat not only the epidemic per se, but perhaps an even more sinister outbreak of fake news and false rumours, a socalled infodemic. The most obvious consequences of an infodemic are, at best, a noisy cacophony that confuses and can provoke irrational fear, even mass panic, and ultimately imposes a destabilising effect on society when precisely the opposite is required. The images of empty supermarket shelves in the most open free-trade economies of Singapore and Hong Kong, where fewer than 100 cases have been reported to date, provide a salutary reminder of the potential impact of such infodemics. Another example is the worldwide shortage of and some national export bans on face masks. Creating a resource such as Sun and colleagues have compiled in their work would allow scientists and lay observers alike to quickly fill knowledge vacuums that would otherwise fuel infodemics.\\nRelated to the infodemic is the so-called geodemic of geopolitical considerations and nationalistic populism apparently being placed ahead of the science of outbreak control. A case in point relates to national border policies that have been suggested to contravene International Health Regulations. 4 Anecdotes of xenophobic treatment of people from different places or fellow natives who look different are doing substantial harm to building the extra solidarity necessary in such times.\\nFinally, the epidemic, infodemic, and geodemic all have economic costs. 5 During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, China accounted for 4% of global economic output compared with 16% today. 5 Despite the ongoing trade tensions since 2019, China's supply chains and production lines remain closely enmeshed with much of the world's trading markets. These economic uncertainties, of course, have not taken into account how the outbreak might affect the rest of the world, when cases have now been reported on most continents, including Africa.\\nNotwithstanding the above motivations, during the exigency of an outbreak, especially one with a doubling time of 1 week 2 in the world's most populated country, expecting a ready line list for analytical prosecution covering all domestic geographies within a few short weeks would be astounding. Even during the SARS outbreak in 2003, we worked through over 30 versions of the case-contact questionnaire before settling on the final version well over a month after the first case had been confirmed. Notably, China's health protection function is decentralised to provincial and local levels (with over 300 prefecture-level Centers for Disease Control and Prevention branches) and it remains a developing country with differing levels of epidemic preparedness along socioeconomic development gradients across a large geography. 8 Crowdsourced data could be compiled and analysed as timely as, or perhaps even quicker than, officially released data. However, such future developments do not negate the overriding importance of the timely release and updating of official line lists with as much detail as ethics and confidentiality allow. However, such sourcing would go a long way to address and mitigate the epidemics, infodemics, and geodemics that the world will face in the years to come.\\nWe declare no competing interests.    \n",

J. King, Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, Athens, GA. The virus was propagated by inoculation of 10-d-old embryonated chicken eggs by the allantoic route, 0.1 ml per egg (SPAFAS, Charles River Laboratories Inc., Wilmington, MA). Allantoic fluid was harvested from eggs that died 3–4 d postinoculation. Titration of the virus was accomplished by preparation of 10-fold dilutions of allantoic fluid in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) and inoculation of 0.2 ml of each dilution onto confluent monolayers of chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells in 48-well tissue culture plates, four wells per dilution. Five days after inoculation, contents of wells were decanted into a container containing sodium hypochlorite to inactivate live virus, and cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Titer was determined by calculation of the 50% infectious doses (ID50) as described by Reed and Muench (1938). An inoculum was prepared to contain ≈107 ID50/0.1 ml, and it was stored at −70°C.\\nSerum samples were assayed for presence of NDV-specific antibody by using a hemagglutination inhibition test as described previously (Beard 1989).\\nHouse flies used in this study have been maintained in culture at North Carolina State University since 1997. The colony was established from wild-captured flies from a dairy. Collected house fly eggs were added to a prepared house fly larval medium. Fly larvae were reared in sweater boxes at constant temperature (27°C) until pupation. The fly pupae were harvested by flotation 8 d after egg hatch. House fly pupae were stored at room temperature until adult emergence 3 d later. All flies emerging within a 24-h period represent day 0. Adult flies were provided food and water. Once the flies were 3–5 d old, they were separated for use in these experiments.\\nFertile specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken eggs were obtained from SPAFAS, Charles River Laboratories, Inc. Eggs were incubated and hatched at North Carolina State University. One-day-old chickens were housed in electrically heated brooders in an isolation room until chickens were 2 wk of age. Chickens were provided nonmedicated game bird starter and water ad libitum.\\nFour experiments were conducted to examine the survival of NDV in the digestive tract tissues, crops, and intestines (mid- and hindgut) of flies after exposure to NDV (Roakin) and the ability of NDV-exposed flies to transmit the virus to susceptible chicks.\\nAdult flies of mixed sex were separated into two groups of 350 flies each. Adult flies were held for 18 h at 22°C in screened containers without food or water. Flies were anesthetized with cold by placement in a −20°C freezer for 5 min. Small plastic reservoirs containing ≈2,000 μl of NDV (Roakin) inoculum was placed in each fly cage. The control group (n = 350) was administered DMEM without NDV. The flies were given 30 min to fully recover from the cold and to consume the treated and untreated medium.\\n\\nExperiment 1. Survival of NDV in the fly crop, a storage site for liquids before passage to the midgut, was evaluated. After ingestion of the medium, each treatment group was provided food and water and held at room temperature (≈22°C). At 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 96 h postfeeding, the flies were temporarily chilled, and 40 flies were removed from each treatment group. These flies were placed in sterile petri dishes, the dish was labeled for treatment and time interval, and frozen at −70°C.\\nFrozen flies were surface sterilized by immersing the flies in 95% ethanol (EtOH), transferred to 10% bleach (NaOCl) a minimum of 3 min, and rinsed in distilled sterile water. Whole crops (n = 40) were aseptically removed from the flies, pooled, and placed in 2 ml of chilled DMEM plus 1% fetal bovine serum, 1% gentamicin, and amphotericin B. Dissection instruments were sterilized in dilute bleach and EtOH after each dissection. Pooled fly crops were frozen at −70°C. The experiment was replicated three times.\\nPooled fly crops in DMEM with antibiotics were homogenized and clarified by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 20 min at 4°C. Clarified homogenates were prepared as 10-fold dilutions and then assayed for NDV as described above. Presence of virus in samples was determined by titration in CEF cells as described above.\\n\\nExperiment 2. Survival of NDV in house fly intestines was evaluated. A time-delineated experiment was conducted to examine the presence of NDV in the digestive tract of the house fly. Flies were separated into two groups of 350 flies and administered NDV as described above. Groups of 40 flies were examined for the presence of virus at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 96 h postfeeding. Target tissues for experiment 2 were fly mid- and hindgut. After surface sterilization, the terminal abdominal plate was excised and the intestinal tract was gently pulled through the opening. Separating at the proventriculus, the mid- and hindgut tissues remained intact. If gut or crop was compromised, the fly was rejected. Gut tissues were excised from flies (n = 40), pooled, and placed in 2 ml of chilled DMEM supplemented with antibiotics. Pooled fly gut tissues were stored frozen at −70°C. Gut tissues were homogenized and assayed for the presence of virus as described above.\\nFor analysis, Mean NDV titers were calculated from each replicate time interval for crop and gut tissue. We used correlation to test the relationship between live virus titer and time. Regression analysis was used to plot the relationship of titer decay against time. The slope of the curve was calculated using a logarithmic regression model (Minitab, Inc. 1997).\\n\\nExperiment 3. The potential of the house fly to directly transmit NDV to live chicks was investigated. Fourteen-day-old chickens were divided into groups of 10 birds and placed in Horsfall isolation units with negative-pressure ventilation. Chicks were exposed to fly densities of 10, 100, and 250 house flies per isolation unit, and a no fly control for four treatments and replicated twice within experiment and the experiment was conducted twice.\\nApproximately 800 adult house flies (3–5 d old) were divided into three feeding chambers, each holding ≈265 flies. Starved flies were provided NDV-inoculated medium in a reservoir as described above. After the inoculum was consumed, the flies were cold anesthetized and further sorted into two groups of 10 flies, two groups of 100 flies, and two groups of 250 flies. Two hours postfeeding, the flies were released in the isolation chambers, and the bird behavior was observed. One day after the flies were released in the brooders, the fresh air intake was sprayed with 0.30% pyrethrin insecticide synergized with 2.40% piperonyl butoxide (CB-38 ExtraTM, Waterbury Companies Inc., Waterbury, CT) to kill the flies. Dead flies were removed from the chambers.\\nA portion of the NDV-exposed flies was held in reserve to determine NDV titers in whole flies. Immediately after placement of other NDV-exposed flies in Horsfal units, these flies were counted, pooled, homogenized, clarified by centrifugation, and NDV titers were determined as described above. Mean NDV titers per fly were determined by dividing the titer for pooled flies by total number of flies within the homogenate.\\nThe birds were observed daily for clinical signs of infection. At 3-d postexposure, tracheal swabs were collected from each of five birds in each group. Swabs were placed in 1 ml of DMEM, placed on ice, and stored at −70°C. Presence of NDV in tracheal swabs was determined by inoculation of chicken embryo fibroblasts as described above. Chicks were bled for NDV serology on day 21 and euthanatized.\\n\\nExperiment 4. Dose–response study to evaluate effect of dose and inoculation site for NDV (Roakin) infectivity. Fourteen-day-old chickens were divided into eight groups of 10 birds each and placed in separate Horsfall isolation units. Chicks were intranasally inoculated by squirting 100 μl containing a 102, 103, and 104 ID50 of NDV (Roakin) into the left nasal passage. Chicks were inoculated orally by passing a no. 5 French catheter into the crop and delivering 1.0 ml containing the calculated dose of 104, 106, and 108 infectious units NDV (Roakin). Two control groups of 10 birds were sham inoculated. Birds were observed daily for clinical signs of disease. At day 21 postexposure, blood was collected from six birds in each group; all birds then were humanely euthanatized. Serum was evaluated by hemagglutination inhibition assays for presence of NDV-specific antibodies. The experiment was conducted once.   \n",
              "1  RSV A2 strain was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, MA). EZ vaccine strain was from Serum Institute of India (Pune, India). Vero and HEp-2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagles’s medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2mM L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C with 5% CO2.\\nAntigenomic cDNA was synthesized by DNA2.0 (Menlo Park, CA) based on the sequence of live attenuated measles virus Edmonston-Zagreb strain (NCBI DNA accession number F266290). The T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence was added to the 5’ end of the antigenomic cDNA and the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme and a T7 RNA polymerase terminator sequences were added to the 3’ end of the antigenomic cDNA. Sequence at nucleotides 5502 (Sca I) and 9343 (Mlu I) was modified to facilitate cDNA cloning. The three amino acid residues at positions 3682, 3862 and 10555 (3682K→R, 3862S→N, 10555K→R) that were different from the EZ vaccine strains were corrected by site-directed mutagenesis. The MV antigenomic cDNA was cloned into pUC18 vector and denoted as pEZ (Fig. 1). Supporting plasmids encoding measles N, P and L genes were cloned into pCITE plasmids under the control of T7 promoter as previously described and were designed pN, pP and pL respectively [30].\\nThe ectodomain of RSV F and EBV gp350 ectodomains were inserted into the non-coding region 3' proximal of the N gene or in the junction between the P and M genes of pEZ (Fig. 1). Each inserted gene contained measles virus transcriptional unit consisting of the sequences of N gene stop (GE-N) and P gene start (GS-P). To insert the RSV F gene into the promoter proximal location, a pUC-SnaBI/SacII (pUC-S/S) subclone that contained the T7 promoter and MV sequence of 1 to 2044 with a silent mutation at nt 821 to knockout EcoRV enzyme site was generated. A gene cassette containing the ectodomain of RSV-F (aa 1-524) followed by GE-N and GS-P sequence were inserted into EcoRV site at nt 99. The genomic DNA was in multiples of 6 nucleotides (the rule of six). The SnaB I-Sac II fragment was swiped back to pEZ antigenomic cDNA (Fig. 1A) and the resulting cDNA was denoted as pEZ-RSVsF1.\\nTo insert the RSV F gene and EBV gp350 gene into pEZ between the P and M genes, a pUC-SacII/NarI (pUC-S/N) subclone that contained the MV sequence of 2045 nt to 4924 nt was constructed. A gene cassette containing gene end (GE) of N, gene start (GS) of P and ectodomain of RSV-F (aa 1-524), full length (aa 1 -861) or truncated (aa 1-470) ectodomain of gp350 at SpeI site (nt 3372). The Sac II to Nar I fragment was swiped back to pEZ antigenomic cDNA (Fig. 1A) and the resulting cDNA was denoted as pEZ-RSVsF3, pEZ-EBVgp350 and pEZ-EBVgp350tr respectively.\\nRescue of the recombinant viruses from MV antigenomic cDNA was performed as previously described [16, 30, 31]. Briefly, HEp-2 cells were infected with MVA-T7 at a multiplicity of infectivity (moi) of 5 for an hour prior to transfection. A DNA mixture of pEZ (0.8 μg), pN (0.4 μg), pP (0.4 μg) and pL (0.2 μg) were co-transfected into MVA-T7 infected HEp-2 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The culture medium was replaced with DMEM containing 2% FBS after overnight incubation at 37oC. The transfected cells were incubated for an additional 3 to 4 days and the culture supernatant was used to infect fresh Vero cells to amplify the rescued virus. The rescued viruses were then plaque purified twice in Vero cells. The viruses rescued from pEZ, pEZ-RSVsF1, pEZ-RSVsF3, pEZ-EBVgp350 and pEZ-EBVgp350tr were designated as rEZ, sF1, sF3, gp350 and gp350tr, respectively.\\nReplication kinetics of rEZ, gp350, gp350tr, sF1 or sF3 viruses was compared in Vero cells. Vero cells in six-well plates were infected with each virus at a MOI of 0.01 in triplicates. After a 1 hour adsorption at room temperature, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with 2 mL of complete DMEM at 35oC with 5% CO2. Aliquots of culture supernatant were collected daily from each well for 7 days and stored at -80oC until virus titration. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay in Vero cells as previously described [32]. Replication kinetic was performed twice in triplicate and each supernatant sample was titered in duplicate.\\nVero cells were infected at a MOI of 3.0 with rEZ, gp350, gp350tr, sF1 or sF3 for 18 hours at 37°C. Culture supernatant and cells were harvested separately. The cells were scraped and pelleted for 10 sec at 6,000 rpm in microfuge tubes and lysed in lysis buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% [vol/vol] protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 8.0) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 10 min on ice. The resulting cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min.\\nProteins from culture supernatant or cell lysates were separated by electrophoresis and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. Viral proteins were detected with anti-measles nucleoprotein (clone 2D7, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal rabbit EBV gp350 [33] or monoclonal antibody against RSV F proteins (palivizumab, MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD) antibodies. Intensities of the bands were quantified by ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Relative intensity was determined by comparing pixel intensity of the band relative to the rEZ control.\\nSpecific-pathogen-free 6- to 8-week-old cotton rats were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). The animal study protocol was approved by MedImmune’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane by inhalation and vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) with 105 PFU of rEZ, gp350tr, gp350, sF1 or sF3 in a 200 μl inoculum volume. The control groups were inoculated intramuscularly (i.m) with PBS, 105 PFU of UV-inactivated sF3, or intransally (i.n) with 106 PFU of RSV A2 strain. The animals were boosted with the same dose of viruses 4 weeks later.\\nThe animals were observed for clinical signs daily and bled at 14-day intervals to measure antibody responses. Twenty-eight days after the second immunization, the cotton rats from measles virus vectored RSV vaccine groups were challenged with 106 PFU of RSV A2 strain i.n. The lungs were harvested on day 4 post-challenge and viral titers were determined by plaque assay.\\nAdult rhesus macaques aged 3-9 year-old were used for the immunogenicity study at Valley Biosystems (West Sacramento, CA). All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee at MedImmune and Valley Biosystems. Measles vaccine immunization history of the rhesus macaques was confirmed by neutralization assay prior to the study. A total of 16 rhesus macaques (8 measles virus seropositive, 8 naïve) were used in the study. Half of the animals (4 measles virus sero-positive, 4 naïve) received two doses of gp350 intramuscularly using 105 PFU/inoculation and the other half received two doses of sF3 at the same dose intramuscularly. The inoculations were performed at 4 week intervals. Blood was drawn from each animal every 14 days to assess immune responses. Animals were anesthetized with ketamine intramuscularly at each procedure. Clinical symptoms were monitored by veterinarians for the duration of the study.\\nEBV gp350- or RSV F-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed to determine the levels of gp350 or F protein-specific antibodies. Briefly, 100 ng of purified recombinant soluble EBV gp350 or RSV F protein expressed from mammalian cells was adsorbed onto Immulon 2B plates overnight in PBS at 4°C. The plate was blocked with 5% BSA in PBS. Serial dilutions of animal sera in PBS/1%BSA were added to the plate and incubated for an hour at room temperature. After washing, HRP-conjugated anti-cotton rat IgG (Immunology Consultants Laboratory, Newberg, OR) or anti-rhesus macaques IgG (Rockland Immunochemicals, Boyertown, PA) were added and incubated for 1 hour. Finally, the plate was developed with tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase substrate (KPL, Rockford, IL) and stopped with HCl. Absorbances of the samples were read at 450 nm and the titer for each sample was calculated by determining the dilution at which the absorbance reached 2 times over the reading of no serum control. The lower limits of detection were 3.3 log2 and 6.6 log2 for EBV gp350 ELISA and RSV F ELISA, respectively.\\nMeasles virus specific neutralizing antibodies were determined as described previously [34] in 96-well plates using Vero cells. Neutralizing antibody titer is defined as the highest dilution that inhibits 50% CPE. RSV specific neutralizing antibody was determined by the plaque reduction neutralization assay as described previously [35]. The lower limit of detection was 4.3 log2 and 3.0 log2 for MV microneutralization and RSV plaque reduction assays, respectively. EBV specific neutralizing antibody titer was determined by the method described by Sashihara et al.,[36].\\nELISpot assays were performed with spleens from vaccinated and control cotton rats 14 days after the second dose and peripheral blood mononucleocyte cells (PBMC) of rhesus monkeys 28 days after the second dose. Splenocytes were isolated as previously described [37]. Splenocytes were counted using Vi-Cell (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and Interleukin 4-secreting T cells were quantified in an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay using R&D DuoSet ELISA System for cotton rat IFN-γ and IL-4 antibodies (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) as previously described using 10 μg/mL of EBV gp350 or RSV F proteins for stimulation [38]. Spots were scanned and counted by ImmunoSpot spot Analyzer (Cellular Technology, Cleveland, OH). The numbers of IFN-γ or IL-4 secreting cells were expressed as the number cells per 106 cells.\\nGraphPad Prism software was used to analyze the data (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). All data were expressed as the mean and standard error. The data were also analyzed by Mann-Whitney rank sum test to compare data distribution between any two experimental groups. Titer comparison between viruses in replication kinetic experiment was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, assuming non-parametric distribution.   \n",

All culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin.\\nGeneration of U2OS NPC1-ko cells was carried out by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing (62) using previously described methods (26). Briefly, a CRISPR guide RNA (gRNA) cloning vector (Addgene plasmid 41824) encoding an NPC1-specific gRNA that targets nucleotides 768 to 790 (5′ GGCCTTGTCATTACTTGAGGGGG 3′ on the complementary strand) of human NPC1 mRNA was cotransfected along with a plasmid encoding human-codon-optimized endonuclease Cas9 (Addgene plasmid 41815), a red fluorescent protein expression plasmid (to monitor transfection efficiency), and pMX-IRES-Bla (conferring blasticidin resistance to transfected cells). Following selection of transfected cells by blasticidin treatment, genomic DNA flanking the gRNA target site was amplified by PCR using forward (5′ TCATAAACACACCAAACTTGGAATC 3′) and reverse (5′ TCCTGCGGCAGAGGTTTTC 3′) primers and tested for indels by Surveyor assay as previously described (26). Once genome editing was confirmed at the population level, multiple single-cell clones were isolated for NPC1 gene sequencing. A clonal cell line, NPC1-#6, was found to contain a deletion of 13 nucleotides in both of its NPC1 alleles. The deletion in NPC1-#6 cells is predicted to cause a frame shift at amino acid position 167 that leads to production of a truncated protein of 215 amino acids, in comparison to the 1,278 amino acids of wild-type NPC1. We confirmed the absence of any remaining wild-type NPC1 alleles by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using NPC1-F (5′ AGGCCCCCTCAAGTAATGAC 3′, specific for the deleted sequence in the NPC1-knockout cell line) and npc1-R (5′ GCCCAAAGTGCTGGTCAAAG 3′) primers. Amplification of the site-1 protease (S1P) gene using S1P-F (5′ GATGTGCTCTGGCAGATGGG 3′) and S1P-R (5′ TTTCACGCCAGAACCCCGC 3′) primers was used as a positive control for RT-PCR.\\nPseudotyped virions were generated by infecting 293T cells expressing viral glycoproteins with VSV lacking its G gene, as previously described (19, 26, 28). GP cDNA derived from EBOV/H.sap/COD/76/Yam-Mayinga (EBOV “Mayinga” isolate) was used to generate VSV-EBOV GP. EBOV GPΔMuc lacks GP residues 309 to 489 (29). All EBOV GP mutants were generated in the GPΔMuc background. Infection supernatants were collected upon observation of significant cytopathy (1 to 4 days postinfection). Clarified supernatants were centrifuged at 4°C and 70,000 × g using an SW28 rotor to pellet the virus. Viral pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and further purified through a 10% sucrose cushion at 4°C and 107,000 × g using an SW41 rotor. Pellets were then resuspended in PBS at an approximate viral protein concentration of 1 mg/ml, and aliquots were stored at −80°C until use. Viral infectivity was assessed as previously described (19).\\nCleavage of EBOV-GP was performed by incubating the virus with 250 µg/ml thermolysin (Sigma) for 1 h for partially cleaved GP and 500 µg/ml thermolysin for 2 h for fully cleaved GP at 37°C after the first ultracentrifugation step. Protease activity was quenched by addition of 1 mM phosphoramidon (Peptides International) and incubation on ice for 20 min prior to the second ultracentrifugation step through a sucrose cushion. The extent of cleavage was confirmed by immunoblotting with an anti-GP1 antibody.\\nViral membranes were labeled with self-quenching concentrations of DiD (Life Technologies). Virus (50 µg) was incubated with 250 µM DiD for 90 min with gentle agitation in the dark at room temperature. Labeled virus was passed through a NAP-5 column (GE Healthcare) to remove excess dye and large aggregates and was used for imaging within 48 h. DiD labeling reduced viral infectivity by less than 10% (data not shown).\\nZMapp was a gift from John Dye (USAMRIID). For production of KZ52, various heavy- and light-chain domains of KZ52 were chemically synthesized as codon-optimized sequences for expression in human cells by Epoch Life Sciences and cloned into pMAZ-IgH (containing the expression cassette of human γ1 chain constant domains) and pMAZ-IgL (containing the expression cassette of human κ light-chain constant domains) vectors (63), respectively, using a Gibson assembly kit (New England Biolabs). Sanger sequencing confirmed the identity of the cloned vectors. Antibody production and purification were carried out as described earlier (64), with modifications. Briefly, suspension-adapted HEK293-Freestyle cells–grown in suspension cultures in Freestyle F17 expression media (Thermo Scientific)–were cotransfected with pMAZ-IgH-KZ52 and pMAZ-IgL-KZ52 (1:1 ratio) vectors using polyethyleneimine. At 6 to 7 days posttransfection, the supernatant was collected and incubated overnight at 4°C with protein A agarose resin (GenScript Corporation) in the presence of cOmplete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Life Sciences). After the resin was washed with PBS (pH 8.0), bound IgG was eluted with 100 mM glycine (pH 3.0) into 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The eluate was concentrated and buffer exchanged with PBS by use of an Amicon centrifugal filter concentrator (Millipore) with a molecular weight cutoff of 30,000 Da. Purified antibody was stored at −20°C. Protein concentration and yield were determined by UV absorbance, and purity was determined by SDS-PAGE. For labeling coverslip-bound virus, KZ52 was conjugated with Zenon Alexa Fluor 555 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\\nStock solutions of drugs were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or water and stored as frozen aliquots until use. Cells were incubated with ammonium chloride (Sigma) for 15 min or with E-64d (Peptides International) and tetrandrine (Sigma) for 1 h prior to experiments performed at the indicated concentrations. No preincubation with U18666A (Calbiochem) was performed. Inhibitors were maintained at the same concentrations during spinoculation and imaging.\\nFor expression of fluorescently labeled endocytic pathway markers, cells were transduced with CellLight vectors (Life Technologies) for early endosomes (GFP-Rab5), late endosomes (GFP-Rab7), or lysosomes (GFP-LAMP1) 18 h prior to imaging according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A retroviral packaging vector bearing NPC1-mNG was also generated, and cells were transduced 18 h in advance of imaging.\\nLive imaging was performed on a DeltaVision widefield epifluorescence microscope (GE Healthcare) at 37°C. The microscope was equipped with a heated environmental chamber, an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) camera (Photometrics), a 40×/1.35 numerical-aperture (NA) oil immersion objective, and a DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)/fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/tetramethyl rhodamine isocyanate (TRITC)/Cy5 filter set.\\nCells were seeded on fibronectin-coated 35-mm-diameter coverslip dishes (MatTek) 24 h in advance of experiments and were grown to approximately 70% confluence. Dishes were placed on ice for several minutes before addition of virus. Virus in imaging buffer (140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose, 2 µg/ml Hoechst stain, and 2% FBS, pH 7.4) was spinoculated onto cells by 20 min of centrifugation at 1,500 × g at 4°C. Inoculum volumes were adjusted so that 200 to 400 cell-associated particles were visible per field. Unbound particles were removed by four washes with cold PBS, and 500 µl cold imaging buffer was added to the dish. Samples were mounted on the microscope and quickly focused, and then 1.5 ml warm imaging buffer was added to start the experiment (t = 0). Images were acquired every 4 s over the duration of the experiments using a single Z-section, as the cells were very flat. Excluding the initial kinetics studies, all experiments were limited to 2 h.\\nImage analysis and single-particle tracking were performed using Volocity software (PerkinElmer). Excluding minor adjustments in brightness and contrast, image files were not manipulated. For single-particle dequenching measurements, puncta were thresholded by initial intensity and size. Puncta falling outside the range of 0.125 to 1.0 µm2 expected of discrete VSV particles were excluded from analysis.\\nFor colocalization of dequenching particles with cellular markers, a virion was considered colocalized only if the GFP or mNG punctum exceeded the cellular background signal by 30% or more and if the GFP or mNG and DiD puncta cotrafficked (greater than 80% overlap of DiD signal with GFP or mNG signal) for at least 20 s before and after a dequenching event. The majority of colocalized dequenching events far exceeded these criteria.\\nMean measurements (± standard deviations [SD]) were derived from three separate experiments, unless otherwise indicated. Statistical significance was established by Student’s t test or by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a post hoc Dunnett’s test (**, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ****, P < 0.0001).   \n",



                                              Adult house flies harbored Newcastle Disease virus in both crop and gut tissues. Live NDV was detected in crops tissues of house flies for 96 h postfeeding in two of three replicated experiments (Table 1). In the one replicate, NDV was detectable at 24 h postexposure, but not at 96 h. Virus titers were greatest within 30 min of a single feeding of the flies. NDV titer decay was predictably time dependent from 0.5 to 24 h following the logistic model [y = −0.4306ln(x) + 2.0187; R2 = 0.7329] (Fig. 1). Virus titers would be expected to remain stable or increase if NDV survived or was replicated in the fly tissues. NDV was not detected in the tissues of sham-exposed flies collected at the same time intervals.\\nNDV was detected in the gut tissues of the house fly for 24 h postfeeding (Table 2. ) Titration of NDV in gut tissues at the 30-min interval was greater than that found in the crop tissues. The 24-h rate of decay in virus titer was time dependent in the gut tissues [y = −1.2677ln(x) + 4.3786; R2 = 0.914] (Fig. 1). Little virus as detected 9 h after the initial exposure to NDV. Virus was not detected in the tissues of sham-exposed flies collected at the same time intervals.\\nNDV-infected house flies were confined to isolation units containing 2-wk-old chicks. Attracted by the movement of the flies within the units, chicks readily consumed all but a few house flies within 24 h.\\nNo virus was isolated from tracheal swabs collected at 3 d postexposure (five birds per group examined); and at day 21, no NDV-specific antibodies were detected (six birds per group examined). NDV titer in pooled NDV-exposed flies was determined to be ≈3 × 104 ID50 per fly.\\nNDV Roakin was infectious to all chickens (100%) when introduced intranasally at doses >103 ID50 (Table 3).

To generate rEZ expressing RSV F or EBV gp350, the F ectodomain of RSV and EBV gp350 were cloned into the MV antigenomic cDNA (Fig. 1A). The F was cloned at the two positions of the viral genome: one proximal to the N gene (1st position) and the other between the P and M genes (3rd position). EBV gp350 ectodomain and its N-terminal half of the gp350 (amino acid 1-470, gp350tr) that encoded the receptor binding site to CD21 [39] were also cloned into the EZ genome at the 1st and 3rd positions. Recombinant EZ with RSV F, EBV gp350 and EBV gp350tr inserted at the 1st or 3rd position were generated. However, viruses with gp350 and gp350tr inserted at the 1st position replicated poorly in vitro and were not evaluated further. The rescued recombinant viruses expressing RSV F or EBV gp350 or gp350tr were designed as sF1 (F at the 1st position), sF3 (F at the 3rd position), gp350 and gp350tr (both at the 3rd position), respectively.\\nTo confirm that these recombinant measles viruses expressed the desired antigens, the expression of the inserts in infected Vero cells was examined by Western blotting analysis. In addition to MV N protein that was detected in infected cell lysate (Fig. 1B), RSV F and EBV gp350 were detected in the culture supernatant of the infected cells (Fig. 1B), indicating the production of secreted form of RSV F and EBVgp350 proteins from virus infected cells. The observation of lower MV N expression in Vero cells infected with sF1 compared to other viruses may be attributed to the insertion of RSV F proximal to the MV N gene, which moved the MV N gene to the 2nd position of the genome and reduced its mRNA transcript level. The relative expression of RSV F to MV N, however, was shown to be higher for sF1 compared to sF3. This is consistent with the observation that genes proximal to 3’ end of the genome are transcribed more abundantly than those downstream and more RSV F was produced from sF1 than sF3 per virion.\\nViral replication efficiency of these recombinant viruses was assessed by growth kinetics in Vero cells. Both recombinant EZ (rEZ) and EZ vaccine viruses grew to a peak titer of 7.9 log10 PFU/mL on day 5 (Fig. 3A). rEZ with either RSVF (Fig. 2A) or EBVgp350 (Fig. 2B) inserts had comparable growth kinetics but slightly lower (between 0.1-0.7 log10 lower) than rEZ. The peak titers between the viruses were not statistically different. sF3 had a faster growth kinetics and reached peak titer on day 3 instead of day 5. Therefore, insertion of RSV F or EBV gp350 into the genome of EZ did not significantly reduce viral growth in vitro.\\nCotton rats had previously been demonstrated to be semi-permissive to measles virus infection [40] and are the best available small animal model for MV infection. In addition, cotton rats are susceptible to RSV infection and have been used in the evaluation of RSV vaccines [41, 42] and anti-RSV antibody investigated for prophylactic application [43]. The ability of rEZ vectored vaccines to induce humoral responses to measles virus and RSV F or EBV gp350 protein were assessed in cotton rats. Cotton rats were immunized \\nwith two doses of rEZ viruses intramuscularly at 4 weeks interval. Sera were collected 4 weeks post dose 1 and 2 weeks post dose 2. Measles virus neutralizing antibodies (MV Ab) were induced rapidly after one dose administration, reaching titers of 6.3-8.7 log2. No significant differences in MV Ab titers were observed among the animals receiving sF1, sF3, gp350 or gp350tr compared to rEZ. The 2nd dose increased MV Ab titers by 2-4 folds (Table 1). The control animals vaccinated with UV-inactivated sF3 or RSV A2 virus did not have detectable MV Ab titer (data not shown).\\nRSV-specific antibody responses were measured by RSV F-specific ELISA and microneutralization assay. sF1 or sF3 induced RSV F-specific IgG antibody in the vaccinated cotton rats (about 15.5-15.9 log2 post dose 1 and 22.1-23.7 log2 post dose 2). The RSV F-specific IgG antibody titers were similar between the sF1 and sF3 vaccinated groups. RSV neutralizing antibody titers were also measured against RSV A2 strain. After the first dose, sF1 and sF3 induced RSV neutralizing Ab and titers were boosted to 7.5-log2 and 8.9-log2 after the second dose (Table 1). There was no statistical difference in antibody response between sF1 and sF3 vaccinated animals and those intranasally infected with 2 doses of RSV A2 strain (9.4 log2 ± 1.5, data not shown). Animals vaccinated with UV-inactivated sF3 did not have detectable RSV antibody (data not shown), indicating that virus immunogenicity was dependent on live virus infection.\\nEBV-specific antibody response was measured by EBV gp350-specific ELISA assay. EBV specific ELISA Ab response was detected after one dose administrations of gp350 or gp350tr; after the 2nd dose the titers reached 7.3 and 4.3 log2 for gp350 and gp350tr vaccinated animals, respectively (Table 1). Gp350 induced a significantly higher EBV gp350-specific IgG titer than gp350tr. EBV specific neutralizing antibody could not be detected by the EBV neutralization assay.\\nCell mediated immune response is important for viral clearance and may play an important role in vaccine mediated protective immune response [44]. RSV F-specific and EBV gp350-specific T cell responses in splenocytes were examined by IFN-γ and IL-4 ELISpot on day 7 post the 2nd dose. The frequencies of RSV F-specific IFN-γ secreting cells were statistically higher in sF3 vaccinated group (average 130 spots/106 splenocytes) compared to sF1 vaccinated (average 9 spots/106 splenocytes) or RSV A2-infected animals (average 45 spots/106 splenocytes) (Fig. 3A). The RSV F-specific IL-4 secreting cells were low, averaged about 20 spots/106 splenocytes for both sF1 and sF3 groups. Surprisingly, no RSV-specific IL-4 secreting cells detected in RSV A2-infected animals (Fig. 3C). Thus, sF3 and RSV induced a Th1-biased response based on the higher IFN-γ to IL-4 secreting cell ratio.\\nThe frequencies of EBV gp350-specific IFN-γ and IL-4 secreting cells for gp350 (average 23 spots and 15 spots/106 splenocytes for IFN-γ and IL-4 respectively) and gp350tr vaccinated groups (average 49 spots and 41 spots/106 splenocytes for IFN-γ and IL-4 respectively) were not statistically different, but were statistically higher than the PBS control group for the gp350tr group (Fig. 3B, D).\\nAnimal model is not available for assessing EBV vaccine induced protective immune response. Cotton rat is the best available small animal model to evaluate RSV vaccine induced protection against wt RSV challenge infection. To assess if the immune responses induced from sF1 and sF3 could provide protection against RSV A2 challenge, vaccinated cotton rats were challenged with RSV A2 intranasally and virus titers in the lungs were measured. Similar to RSV infected animals, sF1 or sF3 offered complete protection against RSV A2 challenge with viral titers in the lungs that was at least 4.5 log10 lower than the control animals. In contrast, cotton rats vaccinated with 105 PFU of UV-inactivated sF3 had viral titer similar to the PBS control group, indicating that viral replication is necessary for induction of protective immune response (Fig. 4).\\nRhesus macaques are fully permissive to measles virus infection and have been used for evaluation of measles vaccine and measles virus pathogenesis studies [45-47]. The ability of rEZ vectored RSV F and EBV gp350 to induce measles virus specific or F or gp350 specific immune responses was examined in this more permissive animal model. Since sF3 demonstrated better immunogenicity than sF1 in cotton rats, only sF3 was evaluated in measles virus seropositive (MV+) rhesus macaques that had prior measles vaccination and measles virus seronegative (MV-) rhesus macaques. No abnormal clinical signs were observed and serum chemistries were within the normal range in all monkeys throughout the study (data not shown). sF3 or gp350 vaccinated monkeys induced a similar level of MV neutralizing antibody in both MV- and MV+ monkeys. A second dose of vaccination with sF3 or gp350 increased MV neutralizing Ab titers by about 4-fold in all groups (Table 2). The Ab titer differences between the groups were not statistically significant.\\nAntibody responses to the inserted genes, however, were relatively low. sF3 inoculated animals had RSV F-specific IgG titer higher than the pre-vaccination level (titers were under the detection limit). F specific IgG Ab titers were 9.3 log2 and 8.8 log2 in MV+ and MV- groups after dose 1, respectively. After a second dose, three out of 4 animals in MV+ group had more than 4-fold increase in RSV F-specific IgG Ab titer but none of the animals in MV- group had 4-fold increase in Ab response (Fig. 5A). After two doses of vaccination, RSV neutralizing Ab titers in all groups were very low in both MV+ and MV- groups. Seven out of 8 animals had a detectable level of RSV neutralizing Ab. The RSV Nt Ab titers were not statistically different between the two groups (5.0 log2 for MV+ versus 4.5 log2 for MV- groups) (Table 2). Ab responses to EBV gp350 in the gp350 vaccinated monkeys were not detected at all time points. Similar to antibody responses, IFN-γ secreting cells in PBMC to measles viral antigens were significantly higher (~10-fold) than the responses to either RSV F or EBV gp350 (Fig. 5B) while PBMC, when stimulated with measles viral antigens, RSV F or EBV gp350, did not secrete any IL-4. Thus, compared to the cotton rat studies, rEZ vectored viruses were poorly immunogenic in the primate model.   \n",
              "2  For evaluating EBOV GP triggering under biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions, we generated vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotypes, which provide a highly validated surrogate system for recapitulating filovirus entry (25, 26). To facilitate viral tracking in most experiments, virions were engineered to contain a fluorescent protein, monomeric NeonGreen (mNG), fused to the viral phosphoprotein (P) (27, 28). The heavily glycosylated mucin domain (Muc) of EBOV GP is dispensable for entry, and its deletion enhances viral attachment (29, 30). Accordingly, we primarily used VSV pseudotypes bearing mucin domain-deleted GP (GPΔMuc). To validate our viral preparations, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine (DiD)-labeled VSV bearing mNG-P and EBOV GPΔMuc was bound to a coverslip and incubated with Alexa Fluor 555-labeled KZ52, a neutralizing antibody that recognizes a conformational epitope at the GP1-GP2 interface (7). On average, over 90% of DiD-labeled particles also possessed NG-P signal, and 72% of total particles exhibited triple-labeling, indicating that the preparations used were of high quality (Fig. 1A).\\nThe lipophilic dye DiD spontaneously incorporates into membranes and displays fluorescence self-quenching at high concentrations. Lipid mixing between viral and host bilayers, as in hemifusion or fusion, enables lateral diffusion of the dye accompanied by dequenching or increased fluorescence intensity (31, 32). Virions were labeled so that the fluorescence signal of self-quenched DiD was detectable prior to dequenching. DiD dequenching resulted in a sharp increase in signal, which we define here as at least a doubling of DiD intensity within 20 s, and a net increase in intensity of 2- to 5-fold within 1 min was typically observed (Fig. 1B and C; see also Movie S1 in the supplemental material). In our experiments, increases in DiD signal sorted strictly into one of two groups: very fast or very slow. Fast dequenching, as indicated by a representative trace (Fig. 1D, solid line), occurred irrespective of nucleocapsid release (data not shown) and appears to indicate specifically triggered lipid mixing events. We attribute the significantly lower rate of DiD dequenching (Fig. 1D, dotted line) to nonspecific transfer of the dye to host membranes, possibly through particle degradation. Only fast events constituted “dequenching” in this study. We found that the extent of dequenching varied somewhat among DiD-labeled particles. This may reflect differences in the volumes of endocytic compartments, as well as in the concentration of dye within the viral membrane, as some heterogeneity in self-quenching was noted. Dequenching events occurring at later postinfection time points generally exhibited greater amplitude between the quenched and dequenched states (data not shown).\\nWe initially investigated dequenching kinetics in Vero cells, due to their high permissivity and established use in filovirus infection studies. The time span needed for 50% of particles bearing EBOV GPΔMuc to dequench (t1/2) was 42 min, considerably greater than the t1/2 of 17 min for similar particles bearing VSV G, which is believed to undergo fusion triggering in early endosomes (Fig. 2A) (33, 34). We found that the dequenching kinetics for VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc particles were very similar in U2OS cells (t1/2 = 44 min, Fig. 2B), and, because autofluorescence is much lower than in Vero cells, we used U2OS cells in the bulk of our experiments. Regardless of cell type, virtually all dequenching events occurred within 2 h of the synchronized onset of infection. We also examined the dequenching kinetics of VSV particles bearing full-length EBOV GP. Although the onset and conclusion of dequenching events showed similar timings, the overall rate of dequenching by VSV-EBOV GP (t1/2 = 64 min) was slower than that of VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc, which may reflect differences in internalization or the need for additional proteolytic processing (Fig. 2C). Precleavage of EBOV GPΔMuc by thermolysin, which structurally and functionally mimics the required cleavage of EBOV GP by endosomal/lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin B (19, 35), did not accelerate dequenching kinetics compared to uncleaved EBOV GPΔMuc.\\nLive imaging revealed that the majority of virions did not engage in lipid mixing (Fig. 2D). Of the total number of cell-associated VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc particles, approximately 16% dequenched in Vero cells and 10% in U2OS cells within 2 h. Additionally, 9.1% of particles bearing full-length EBOV GP dequenched in U2OS cells in the same time span. VSV G particles showed similarly low probabilities for lipid mixing in the two cell types. Although we are unable to distinguish definitively between bound and internalized virions, nearly all cell-associated particles had trafficked to perinuclear regions by the end of experiments (data not shown), leading us to believe that uptake levels are high with both EBOV GP and VSV G. The low percentage of particles with actual relevance to infection validates our single-particle approach to elucidating aspects of EBOV entry.\\nIn order to confirm that the observed dequenching events indeed represented GP-mediated lipid mixing, we first assessed dequenching in the presence of NH4Cl. Failure to acidify endosomes precludes GP activation and infection (36, 37), as low pH is required for cysteine cathepsin activity (38) and possibly for fusogenic conformational changes in GP (39, 40). We found nearly a complete reduction of VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc dequenching by NH4Cl treatment, which lends support to the observed lipid mixing being specifically GP mediated (Fig. 3A).\\nThe need for host cysteine cathepsin cleavage of EBOV GP in infection is well established (19, 35). Pan-cysteine cathepsin inhibitors, such as E-64d, prevent entry by filoviruses, which differ in their preference for cleavage by cathepsin B or L (19, 41). We found that E-64d treatment reduced EBOV GPΔMuc-mediated lipid mixing by more than 90%, while lipid mixing by VSV G-bearing particles was not similarly affected (Fig. 3B), demonstrating that a lack of cysteine cathepsin activity hinders downstream events in lipid mixing for EBOV GP.\\nAs neutralizing antibodies directed against the EBOV GP base, such as KZ52 (7, 42) or c4G7 and c2G4 in the ZMapp antibody cocktail (43–45), have been hypothesized to inhibit fusogenic structural rearrangement, we evaluated their effects on lipid mixing (Fig. 3C). Our results confirm that KZ52 and ZMapp treatments specifically render EBOV GP less able to engage in lipid mixing while leaving viral internalization and trafficking unaltered (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material). Preincubation of VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc with KZ52 resulted in inhibition of dequenching by 60% at 50 µg/ml and 85% at 100 µg/ml. ZMapp also had a concentration-dependent, if slightly more potent, effect on dequenching, with lipid mixing inhibited by 83% at 50 µg/ml and 91% at 100 µg/ml. Neither antibody treatment was able to abolish dequenching, even though the concentrations used were approximately 30-fold to 40-fold higher than the reported IC90 values for viral neutralization by KZ52, c2G4, and c4G7 individually (42, 45). This supports the idea of the existence of a significant barrier to fusion, with the number of unencumbered GP molecules needed for simple lipid mixing being much lower than the number needed to bring about membrane fusion and genome release. Collectively, our results signify that lipid mixing is the express product of GP triggering, which entails some degree of conformational change by proteolytically primed EBOV GP and which may lead to or encompass full fusion.\\nThe endosomal/lysosomal membrane protein NPC1, involved in cholesterol homeostasis, serves as an essential intracellular receptor for filovirus infection, with a cysteine cathepsin-cleaved form of GP directly recognizing the lumenal domain C of NPC1 (20–22, 46). Because the precise role of NPC1 in filovirus entry has not been fully defined, we evaluated lipid mixing in the absence of NPC1 (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). Dequenching of VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc particles was inhibited almost entirely in NPC1-deficient U2OS cells, whereas VSV G dequenching was unaffected, indicating that NPC1 expression is vital for EBOV fusion triggering (Fig. 4A).\\nMutations at the putative GP1-NPC1 interface have been previously demonstrated to reduce GP1-NPC1 interaction and greatly impair infectivity (22, 47, 48). Recent work has shown that proteolytic cleavage of GP1 exposes the NPC1-binding site, comprising a basic/polar crest overhanging a deep hydrophobic trough (65). We investigated entry by VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc particles bearing three mutations in the NPC1-binding site (T83M in the trough, K114E/K115E in the crest) that abolish GP1-NPC1 interaction and viral infectivity (65). Lipid mixing was reduced by 97% with this triple mutant (Fig. 4B). The inhibition of lipid mixing by VSV-EBOV GP in NPC1-deficient U2OS cells and by VSV-EBOV GP (T83M/K114E/K115E) in wild-type (wt) U2OS cells was not explained by altered delivery to endosomal/lysosomal compartments, since postinfection colocalization of viral particles and endocytic markers was not significantly reduced (see Fig. S1B in the supplemental material).\\nNPC1’s functionality as a cholesterol transporter may also have some bearing on EBOV entry, as GP-mediated lipid mixing is selectively inhibited by the cationic amphiphile U18666A (Fig. 4C), which induces an NPC1 disease phenotype marked by cholesterol accumulation within late endosomes and lysosomes (20, 49). GP1-NPC1 binding is not affected by U18666A (20, 24), but short-term U18666A treatments that do not cause substantial cholesterol accumulation (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material) nevertheless prevent EBOV entry (20), suggesting that this block is due to the drug’s specific effect on NPC1 rather than to the resulting increase in endosomal/lysosomal cholesterol levels. Taken together, our results provide direct evidence that NPC1 facilitates one or more early steps in EBOV membrane fusion.\\nColocalization of dequenching virions with fluorescently labeled endosomal markers was performed in order to elucidate the compartment in which EBOV GP-dependent membrane fusion is triggered (Fig. 5; see also Movies S2 to S5 in the supplemental material). Although a recent report suggested that EBOV fuses exclusively in compartments devoid of NPC1 (50), we found that all dequenching particles in NPC1-mNG-expressing cells colocalized with this marker at the time of dequenching (Fig. 5J; see also Movie S5). Additionally, the high percentage of dequenching particles colocalized with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Rab7 (98%) indicates the ubiquity of this protein in endosomes supporting GP triggering. Further evidence that EBOV must traffic to a suitably mature compartment for fusion was provided by inhibition of dequenching by the two-pore calcium channel (TPC)-blocking small molecule tetrandrine (Fig. 6). Tetrandrine, which may impair the activity of TPC in endocytic trafficking and heterotypic fusion of vesicles (51), was recently shown to inhibit EBOV infection in vitro and in vivo (50) and decreased GP-mediated lipid mixing in our assay by 95% at 10 µM.\\nWhile considerable lipid mixing also occurred in GFP-LAMP1+ vesicles (75%), we found, surprisingly, that a significant fraction of dequenching VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc particles (15%) colocalized with GFP-Rab5 puncta. Despite their slower rate of lipid mixing events (Fig. 2C), 10% of particles bearing full-length EBOV GP also dequenched in Rab5+ compartments (data not shown). Because Rab7 appears to be a nearly essential component of the EBOV fusion compartment, these Rab5+ vesicles are likely intermediate endosomes, suggesting that GP triggering can occur earlier in the endocytic pathway than commonly believed (20, 50, 52, 53). Our results also imply that some population of endosomes must display Rab5 and NPC1 concurrently, at least in the U2OS cell line used. We detected an average lag of 6 min (ranging from 40 s to more than 20 min) between colocalization of viral and NPC1 signals and dequenching, indicating that the occurrence of GP triggering is not immediate upon delivery to NPC1+ compartments (Fig. 5K).\\nTo examine the effect of fusion loop mutation on lipid mixing, we tested two previously published GP2 mutants (Fig. 7) (54, 55). Internalization and late endosomal delivery of VSV particles bearing these mutants did not differ significantly from VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc (see Fig. S1C in the supplemental material), indicating that their defects are specific to aspects of fusion. The GP (F535R) mutant, characterized as having impaired membrane binding and insertion capability (54), exhibited no defect in lipid mixing while being unable to support infection. Another fusion loop mutant, GP (L529A/I544A) (54), showed substantially decreased lipid mixing. The L529A/I544A mutation is believed to prevent formation of the hydrophobic fusion loop tip at low pH, with L529 and I544 creating a scaffold along with F535 (54, 55). While nonviable, the double mutant did effect low-level lipid mixing (Fig. 7), suggesting that even severely disrupted GP fusion loops retain some capacity for membrane insertion in cells.\\nIn order to separate possible requirements for cysteine cathepsins pre- and post-NPC1 binding, we evaluated lipid mixing by GP in various cleavage states in the presence and absence of E-64d. Thermolysin was used to generate particles either fully or partially lacking C-terminal GP1 sequences corresponding to the glycan cap and mucin domains (Fig. 8A). While increased infectivity of particles bearing cleaved GP has been reported (19, 30, 35), we did not observe this phenomenon or enhanced lipid mixing. When particles were bound to cells to the same extent, cleaved and uncleaved GP produced similar levels of lipid mixing and infection (Fig. 8B and C). Unexpectedly, we found that dequenching by particles with cleaved EBOV GP was much less susceptible to E-64d blockage and that the degree of lipid mixing correlated with the extent of GP cleavage (Fig. 8C). Fully cleaved GP exhibited slight hyperfusogenicity that was unaffected in the absence of cathepsin activity. The inability of precleavage to rescue infectivity in E-64d-treated cells (Fig. 8B), however, indicates that a specific requirement for cathepsins in fusion pore formation lies post-NPC1 binding.   \n",

(Diptera: Muscidae), were examined for their ability to harbor and transmit Newcastle disease virus (family Paramyxoviridae, genus Avulavirus, NDV) by using a mesogenic NDV strain. Laboratory-reared flies were experimentally exposed to NDV (Roakin strain) by allowing flies to imbibe an inoculum consisting of chicken embryo-propagated virus. NDV was detected in dissected crops and intestinal tissues from exposed flies for up to 96 and 24 h postexposure, respectively; no virus was detected in crops and intestines of sham-exposed flies. The potential of the house fly to directly transmit NDV to live chickens was examined by placing 14-d-old chickens in contact with NDV-exposed house flies 2 h after flies consumed NDV inoculum. NDV-exposed house flies contained ≈10(4) 50% infectious doses (ID(50)) per fly, but no transmission of NDV was observed in chickens placed in contact with exposed flies at densities as high as 25 flies per bird. Subsequent dose–response studies demonstrated that oral exposure, the most likely route for fly-to-chicken transmission, required an NDV (Roakin) dose ≥10(6) ID(50). These results indicate that house flies are capable of harboring NDV (Roakin) but that they are poor vectors of the virus because they carry an insufficient virus titer to cause infection.   \n",

The glycoprotein gene was inserted at the 1(st) or the 3(rd) position of the measles virus genome and the recombinant viruses were generated. Insertion of the foreign gene at the 3(rd) position had a minimal impact on viral replication in vitro. RSV F or EBV gp350 protein was secreted from infected cells. In cotton rats, EZ-RSV F and EZ-EBV gp350 induced MV- and insert-specific antibody responses. In addition, both vaccines also induced insert specific interferon gamma (IFN-γ) secreting T cell response. EZ-RSV F protected cotton rats from pulmonary replication of RSV A2 challenge infection. In rhesus macaques, although both EZ-RSV F and EZ-EBV gp350 induced MV specific neutralizing antibody responses, only RSV F specific antibody response was detected. Thus, the immunogenicity of the foreign antigens delivered by measles vaccine virus is dependent on the nature of the insert and the animal models used for vaccine evaluation.   \n",
              "2  Ebola virus (EBOV) makes extensive and intricate use of host factors in the cellular endosomal/lysosomal pathway to release its genome into the cytoplasm and initiate infection. Following viral internalization into endosomes, host cysteine proteases cleave the EBOV fusion glycoprotein (GP) to unmask the binding site for its intracellular receptor, the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). GP-NPC1 interaction is required for viral entry. Despite these and other recent discoveries, late events in EBOV entry following GP-NPC1 binding and culminating in GP-catalyzed fusion between viral and cellular lipid bilayers remain enigmatic. A mechanistic understanding of EBOV membrane fusion has been hampered by the failure of previous efforts to reconstitute fusion in vitro or at the cell surface. This report describes an assay to monitor initial steps directly in EBOV membrane fusion—triggering of GP and virus-cell lipid mixing—by single virions in live cells. Fusogenic triggering of GP occurs predominantly in Rab7-positive (Rab7(+)) endosomes, absolutely requires interaction between proteolytically primed GP and NPC1, and is blocked by key GP-specific neutralizing antibodies with therapeutic potential. Unexpectedly, cysteine protease inhibitors do not inhibit lipid mixing by virions bearing precleaved GP, even though they completely block cytoplasmic entry by these viruses, as shown previously. These results point to distinct cellular requirements for different steps in EBOV membrane fusion and suggest a model in which host cysteine proteases are dispensable for GP fusion triggering after NPC1 binding but are required for the formation of fusion pores that permit genome delivery.   \n",

              "      <td>NDV (Roakin strain) was obtained from Dr. D. J. King, Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, Athens, GA. The virus was propagated by inoculation of 10-d-old embryonated chicken eggs by the allantoic route, 0.1 ml per egg (SPAFAS, Charles River Laboratories Inc., Wilmington, MA). Allantoic fluid was harvested from eggs that died 3–4 d postinoculation. Titration of the virus was accomplished by preparation of 10-fold dilutions of allantoic fluid in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) and inoculation of 0.2 ml of each dilution onto confluent monolayers of chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells in 48-well tissue culture plates, four wells per dilution. Five days after inoculation, contents of wells were decanted into a container containing sodium hypochlorite to inactivate live virus, and cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Titer was determined by calculation of the 50% infectious doses (ID50) as described by Reed and Muench (1938). An inoculum was prepared to contain ≈107 ID50/0.1 ml, and it was stored at −70°C.\\nSerum samples were assayed for presence of NDV-specific antibody by using a hemagglutination inhibition test as described previously (Beard 1989).\\nHouse flies used in this study have been maintained in culture at North Carolina State University since 1997. The colony was established from wild-captured flies from a dairy. Collected house fly eggs were added to a prepared house fly larval medium. Fly larvae were reared in sweater boxes at constant temperature (27°C) until pupation. The fly pupae were harvested by flotation 8 d after egg hatch. House fly pupae were stored at room temperature until adult emergence 3 d later. All flies emerging within a 24-h period represent day 0. Adult flies were provided food and water. Once the flies were 3–5 d old, they were separated for use in these experiments.\\nFertile specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken eggs were obtained from SPAFAS, Charles River Laboratories, Inc. Eggs were incubated and hatched at North Carolina State University. One-day-old chickens were housed in electrically heated brooders in an isolation room until chickens were 2 wk of age. Chickens were provided nonmedicated game bird starter and water ad libitum.\\nFour experiments were conducted to examine the survival of NDV in the digestive tract tissues, crops, and intestines (mid- and hindgut) of flies after exposure to NDV (Roakin) and the ability of NDV-exposed flies to transmit the virus to susceptible chicks.\\nAdult flies of mixed sex were separated into two groups of 350 flies each. Adult flies were held for 18 h at 22°C in screened containers without food or water. Flies were anesthetized with cold by placement in a −20°C freezer for 5 min. Small plastic reservoirs containing ≈2,000 μl of NDV (Roakin) inoculum was placed in each fly cage. The control group (n = 350) was administered DMEM without NDV. The flies were given 30 min to fully recover from the cold and to consume the treated and untreated medium.\\n\\nExperiment 1. Survival of NDV in the fly crop, a storage site for liquids before passage to the midgut, was evaluated. After ingestion of the medium, each treatment group was provided food and water and held at room temperature (≈22°C). At 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 96 h postfeeding, the flies were temporarily chilled, and 40 flies were removed from each treatment group. These flies were placed in sterile petri dishes, the dish was labeled for treatment and time interval, and frozen at −70°C.\\nFrozen flies were surface sterilized by immersing the flies in 95% ethanol (EtOH), transferred to 10% bleach (NaOCl) a minimum of 3 min, and rinsed in distilled sterile water. Whole crops (n = 40) were aseptically removed from the flies, pooled, and placed in 2 ml of chilled DMEM plus 1% fetal bovine serum, 1% gentamicin, and amphotericin B. Dissection instruments were sterilized in dilute bleach and EtOH after each dissection. Pooled fly crops were frozen at −70°C. The experiment was replicated three times.\\nPooled fly crops in DMEM with antibiotics were homogenized and clarified by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 20 min at 4°C. Clarified homogenates were prepared as 10-fold dilutions and then assayed for NDV as described above. Presence of virus in samples was determined by titration in CEF cells as described above.\\n\\nExperiment 2. Survival of NDV in house fly intestines was evaluated. A time-delineated experiment was conducted to examine the presence of NDV in the digestive tract of the house fly. Flies were separated into two groups of 350 flies and administered NDV as described above. Groups of 40 flies were examined for the presence of virus at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 96 h postfeeding. Target tissues for experiment 2 were fly mid- and hindgut. After surface sterilization, the terminal abdominal plate was excised and the intestinal tract was gently pulled through the opening. Separating at the proventriculus, the mid- and hindgut tissues remained intact. If gut or crop was compromised, the fly was rejected. Gut tissues were excised from flies (n = 40), pooled, and placed in 2 ml of chilled DMEM supplemented with antibiotics. Pooled fly gut tissues were stored frozen at −70°C. Gut tissues were homogenized and assayed for the presence of virus as described above.\\nFor analysis, Mean NDV titers were calculated from each replicate time interval for crop and gut tissue. We used correlation to test the relationship between live virus titer and time. Regression analysis was used to plot the relationship of titer decay against time. The slope of the curve was calculated using a logarithmic regression model (Minitab, Inc. 1997).\\n\\nExperiment 3. The potential of the house fly to directly transmit NDV to live chicks was investigated. Fourteen-day-old chickens were divided into groups of 10 birds and placed in Horsfall isolation units with negative-pressure ventilation. Chicks were exposed to fly densities of 10, 100, and 250 house flies per isolation unit, and a no fly control for four treatments and replicated twice within experiment and the experiment was conducted twice.\\nApproximately 800 adult house flies (3–5 d old) were divided into three feeding chambers, each holding ≈265 flies. Starved flies were provided NDV-inoculated medium in a reservoir as described above. After the inoculum was consumed, the flies were cold anesthetized and further sorted into two groups of 10 flies, two groups of 100 flies, and two groups of 250 flies. Two hours postfeeding, the flies were released in the isolation chambers, and the bird behavior was observed. One day after the flies were released in the brooders, the fresh air intake was sprayed with 0.30% pyrethrin insecticide synergized with 2.40% piperonyl butoxide (CB-38 ExtraTM, Waterbury Companies Inc., Waterbury, CT) to kill the flies. Dead flies were removed from the chambers.\\nA portion of the NDV-exposed flies was held in reserve to determine NDV titers in whole flies. Immediately after placement of other NDV-exposed flies in Horsfal units, these flies were counted, pooled, homogenized, clarified by centrifugation, and NDV titers were determined as described above. Mean NDV titers per fly were determined by dividing the titer for pooled flies by total number of flies within the homogenate.\\nThe birds were observed daily for clinical signs of infection. At 3-d postexposure, tracheal swabs were collected from each of five birds in each group. Swabs were placed in 1 ml of DMEM, placed on ice, and stored at −70°C. Presence of NDV in tracheal swabs was determined by inoculation of chicken embryo fibroblasts as described above. Chicks were bled for NDV serology on day 21 and euthanatized.\\n\\nExperiment 4. Dose–response study to evaluate effect of dose and inoculation site for NDV (Roakin) infectivity. Fourteen-day-old chickens were divided into eight groups of 10 birds each and placed in separate Horsfall isolation units. Chicks were intranasally inoculated by squirting 100 μl containing a 102, 103, and 104 ID50 of NDV (Roakin) into the left nasal passage. Chicks were inoculated orally by passing a no. 5 French catheter into the crop and delivering 1.0 ml containing the calculated dose of 104, 106, and 108 infectious units NDV (Roakin). Two control groups of 10 birds were sham inoculated. Birds were observed daily for clinical signs of disease. At day 21 postexposure, blood was collected from six birds in each group; all birds then were humanely euthanatized. Serum was evaluated by hemagglutination inhibition assays for presence of NDV-specific antibodies. The experiment was conducted once.\\nAdult house flies harbored Newcastle Disease virus in both crop and gut tissues. Live NDV was detected in crops tissues of house flies for 96 h postfeeding in two of three replicated experiments (Table 1). In the one replicate, NDV was detectable at 24 h postexposure, but not at 96 h. Virus titers were greatest within 30 min of a single feeding of the flies. NDV titer decay was predictably time dependent from 0.5 to 24 h following the logistic model [y = −0.4306ln(x) + 2.0187; R2 = 0.7329] (Fig. 1). Virus titers would be expected to remain stable or increase if NDV survived or was replicated in the fly tissues. NDV was not detected in the tissues of sham-exposed flies collected at the same time intervals.\\nNDV was detected in the gut tissues of the house fly for 24 h postfeeding (Table 2. ) Titration of NDV in gut tissues at the 30-min interval was greater than that found in the crop tissues. The 24-h rate of decay in virus titer was time dependent in the gut tissues [y = −1.2677ln(x) + 4.3786; R2 = 0.914] (Fig. 1). Little virus as detected 9 h after the initial exposure to NDV. Virus was not detected in the tissues of sham-exposed flies collected at the same time intervals.\\nNDV-infected house flies were confined to isolation units containing 2-wk-old chicks. Attracted by the movement of the flies within the units, chicks readily consumed all but a few house flies within 24 h.\\nNo virus was isolated from tracheal swabs collected at 3 d postexposure (five birds per group examined); and at day 21, no NDV-specific antibodies were detected (six birds per group examined). NDV titer in pooled NDV-exposed flies was determined to be ≈3 × 104 ID50 per fly.\\nNDV Roakin was infectious to all chickens (100%) when introduced intranasally at doses &gt;103 ID50 (Table 3). When NDV Roakin was administered to chickens by oral gavage, all chicks (100%) were seropositive when inoculated with 108 ID50 of virus. No chicks became infected when orally inoculated with 104 ID50 of virus.\\nThe house fly satisfies many requirements of an efficient vector: abundance, mobility, tendency to feed on manure, and ability to harbor pathogenic agents. The current study demonstrates the potential of the house fly to harbor NDV in the crop and gut tissues, and it confirms the findings of Milushev et al. (1977). Virus was detectible in the fly crop for 96 h after a single feeding event. Virus titers in pooled fly crops ranged from 103 ID50 measured within 30 min of feeding on NDV inoculum to &lt;101 ID50 at 96 h. Although NDV titers in pooled mid- and hindgut tissues were higher (107 ID50/0.2 ml) immediately after a single feeding, live virus was only detectable for 24 h. The starting NDV dose was ≈107 ID50 for both experiment 1 and 2. It is interesting that the crop had much less virus at 30 min than the gut, suggesting that the flies directed a significant portion of the virus containing medium directly to the gut in response to periods of food deprivation. In a previous study, we found turkey coronavirus (family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus, TCV) remained active in the crop of the house fly for 9 h, but it was inactivated in the gut (Calibeo-Hayes et al. 2003). It is likely that midgut proteolytic enzymes inactivate NDV within 24 h and similar enzymes are not present in the crop where the virus may be active longer. As with TCV, the current study indicates that the house fly is a mechanical vector of NDV. The decrease in virus titers indicates that the house fly is not a propagative vector of NDV.\\nPresumably, the potential of the house fly to transmit a disease agent is enhanced by the relative abundance of the vector. In our study, flies were released in isolation units at rates of 10, 100, and 250 flies per unit, simulating conditions that may be found in the field. Although the chicks were observed eating flies that each carried ≈3 × 104 ID50 virus, none of the susceptible chicks became infected. These findings suggested a possible dose effect.\\nSubsequent experimentation to establish an infectious dose necessary for oral exposure indicated that NDV Roakin, when administered by oral gavage at 104 ID50 of virus, was insufficient to cause infection (Table 3); only those birds inoculated with a dose ≥106 ID50 became infected. These findings suggest that NDV transmission, in the current study, failed because chicks failed to ingest an adequate quantity of virus-laden flies; based on calculations chicks would have needed to consume &gt;33 flies to reach a sufficient dose for infection by the oral route. However, intranasal inoculation at 104 ID50 infected 100% of the chicks. Although the house fly did not transmit NDV in our study, the potential to mechanically transmit NDV remains a possibility because NDV was detectable in both crop and gut tissues for up to 96 and 24 h, respectively, postfeeding (Tables 1 and 2).\\nNewcastle disease outbreaks vary significantly in virulence, transmissibility, and persistence (Feener et al. 1993, Kinde et al. 2004). Velogenic forms of the virus are most virulent and cause the greatest mortality, whereas virulent mesogenic forms may cause mortality, and lentogenic forms are generally nonfatal. Live vaccines are usually developed from lentogenic and mesogenic strains and include Mukteswar (mesogenic), Roakin (mesogenic), and La Sota (lentogenic), among others (Alexander 1991). Accordingly, lentogenic vaccines may be administered intranasally and mesogenic vaccines intramuscularly. As with field strains of avian viruses, the virulence of NDV viruses may have bearing on vector competency studies, and virulent velogenic ND may be more amenable to fly transmission at lower doses.\\nIn our study, NDV Roakin was infectious at a dose of 103 ID50 after 100-μl intranasal inoculation. Under epizootic conditions, NDV replicates in the upper respiratory and intestinal tract of the avian host (Feener et al. 1993). Respiratory tract receptor sites may be the initial foci for NDV attachment and becoming systemic as virus spreads to other target organs. Respiratory tract inoculation by house flies is not likely to occur.\\nIn summary, after a single feeding, the house fly harbored live NDV Roakin in both crop and gut tissues 96 and 24 h, respectively. NDV did not replicate in fly crop or digestive tract tissues. Mechanical transmission of NDV by the house fly was not demonstrated in the current study. In controlled experiments, NDV-exposed house flies did not transmit NDV even though each fly carried ≈104 ID50 of virus when placed in contact with susceptible chickens. This was unexpected, because NDV-exposed flies were eaten by contact chickens soon after placement in isolation units. However, subsequent experiments demonstrated a dose effect for NDV Roakin: an ID50 ≥106 was required to infect chickens by the oral route, the likely route of transmission for NDV by flies. These studies indicate that at least for NDV Roakin, house flies did not carry sufficient quantities of virus to infect chickens and are unlikely vectors. Additional studies using other NDV strains, particularly velogenic strains, are needed to definitively determine the role of house flies as vectors of NDV.</td>\n",
              "      <td>NDV (Roakin strain) was obtained from Dr. D. J. King, Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, Athens, GA. The virus was propagated by inoculation of 10-d-old embryonated chicken eggs by the allantoic route, 0.1 ml per egg (SPAFAS, Charles River Laboratories Inc., Wilmington, MA). Allantoic fluid was harvested from eggs that died 3–4 d postinoculation. Titration of the virus was accomplished by preparation of 10-fold dilutions of allantoic fluid in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) and inoculation of 0.2 ml of each dilution onto confluent monolayers of chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells in 48-well tissue culture plates, four wells per dilution. Five days after inoculation, contents of wells were decanted into a container containing sodium hypochlorite to inactivate live virus, and cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Titer was determined by calculation of the 50% infectious doses (ID50) as described by Reed and Muench (1938). An inoculum was prepared to contain ≈107 ID50/0.1 ml, and it was stored at −70°C.\\nSerum samples were assayed for presence of NDV-specific antibody by using a hemagglutination inhibition test as described previously (Beard 1989).\\nHouse flies used in this study have been maintained in culture at North Carolina State University since 1997. The colony was established from wild-captured flies from a dairy. Collected house fly eggs were added to a prepared house fly larval medium. Fly larvae were reared in sweater boxes at constant temperature (27°C) until pupation. The fly pupae were harvested by flotation 8 d after egg hatch. House fly pupae were stored at room temperature until adult emergence 3 d later. All flies emerging within a 24-h period represent day 0. Adult flies were provided food and water. Once the flies were 3–5 d old, they were separated for use in these experiments.\\nFertile specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken eggs were obtained from SPAFAS, Charles River Laboratories, Inc. Eggs were incubated and hatched at North Carolina State University. One-day-old chickens were housed in electrically heated brooders in an isolation room until chickens were 2 wk of age. Chickens were provided nonmedicated game bird starter and water ad libitum.\\nFour experiments were conducted to examine the survival of NDV in the digestive tract tissues, crops, and intestines (mid- and hindgut) of flies after exposure to NDV (Roakin) and the ability of NDV-exposed flies to transmit the virus to susceptible chicks.\\nAdult flies of mixed sex were separated into two groups of 350 flies each. Adult flies were held for 18 h at 22°C in screened containers without food or water. Flies were anesthetized with cold by placement in a −20°C freezer for 5 min. Small plastic reservoirs containing ≈2,000 μl of NDV (Roakin) inoculum was placed in each fly cage. The control group (n = 350) was administered DMEM without NDV. The flies were given 30 min to fully recover from the cold and to consume the treated and untreated medium.\\n\\nExperiment 1. Survival of NDV in the fly crop, a storage site for liquids before passage to the midgut, was evaluated. After ingestion of the medium, each treatment group was provided food and water and held at room temperature (≈22°C). At 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 96 h postfeeding, the flies were temporarily chilled, and 40 flies were removed from each treatment group. These flies were placed in sterile petri dishes, the dish was labeled for treatment and time interval, and frozen at −70°C.\\nFrozen flies were surface sterilized by immersing the flies in 95% ethanol (EtOH), transferred to 10% bleach (NaOCl) a minimum of 3 min, and rinsed in distilled sterile water. Whole crops (n = 40) were aseptically removed from the flies, pooled, and placed in 2 ml of chilled DMEM plus 1% fetal bovine serum, 1% gentamicin, and amphotericin B. Dissection instruments were sterilized in dilute bleach and EtOH after each dissection. Pooled fly crops were frozen at −70°C. The experiment was replicated three times.\\nPooled fly crops in DMEM with antibiotics were homogenized and clarified by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 20 min at 4°C. Clarified homogenates were prepared as 10-fold dilutions and then assayed for NDV as described above. Presence of virus in samples was determined by titration in CEF cells as described above.\\n\\nExperiment 2. Survival of NDV in house fly intestines was evaluated. A time-delineated experiment was conducted to examine the presence of NDV in the digestive tract of the house fly. Flies were separated into two groups of 350 flies and administered NDV as described above. Groups of 40 flies were examined for the presence of virus at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 96 h postfeeding. Target tissues for experiment 2 were fly mid- and hindgut. After surface sterilization, the terminal abdominal plate was excised and the intestinal tract was gently pulled through the opening. Separating at the proventriculus, the mid- and hindgut tissues remained intact. If gut or crop was compromised, the fly was rejected. Gut tissues were excised from flies (n = 40), pooled, and placed in 2 ml of chilled DMEM supplemented with antibiotics. Pooled fly gut tissues were stored frozen at −70°C. Gut tissues were homogenized and assayed for the presence of virus as described above.\\nFor analysis, Mean NDV titers were calculated from each replicate time interval for crop and gut tissue. We used correlation to test the relationship between live virus titer and time. Regression analysis was used to plot the relationship of titer decay against time. The slope of the curve was calculated using a logarithmic regression model (Minitab, Inc. 1997).\\n\\nExperiment 3. The potential of the house fly to directly transmit NDV to live chicks was investigated. Fourteen-day-old chickens were divided into groups of 10 birds and placed in Horsfall isolation units with negative-pressure ventilation. Chicks were exposed to fly densities of 10, 100, and 250 house flies per isolation unit, and a no fly control for four treatments and replicated twice within experiment and the experiment was conducted twice.\\nApproximately 800 adult house flies (3–5 d old) were divided into three feeding chambers, each holding ≈265 flies. Starved flies were provided NDV-inoculated medium in a reservoir as described above. After the inoculum was consumed, the flies were cold anesthetized and further sorted into two groups of 10 flies, two groups of 100 flies, and two groups of 250 flies. Two hours postfeeding, the flies were released in the isolation chambers, and the bird behavior was observed. One day after the flies were released in the brooders, the fresh air intake was sprayed with 0.30% pyrethrin insecticide synergized with 2.40% piperonyl butoxide (CB-38 ExtraTM, Waterbury Companies Inc., Waterbury, CT) to kill the flies.

              "      <td>House flies, Musca domestica L. (Diptera: Muscidae), were examined for their ability to harbor and transmit Newcastle disease virus (family Paramyxoviridae, genus Avulavirus, NDV) by using a mesogenic NDV strain. Laboratory-reared flies were experimentally exposed to NDV (Roakin strain) by allowing flies to imbibe an inoculum consisting of chicken embryo-propagated virus. NDV was detected in dissected crops and intestinal tissues from exposed flies for up to 96 and 24 h postexposure, respectively; no virus was detected in crops and intestines of sham-exposed flies. The potential of the house fly to directly transmit NDV to live chickens was examined by placing 14-d-old chickens in contact with NDV-exposed house flies 2 h after flies consumed NDV inoculum. NDV-exposed house flies contained ≈10(4) 50% infectious doses (ID(50)) per fly, but no transmission of NDV was observed in chickens placed in contact with exposed flies at densities as high as 25 flies per bird. Subsequent dose–response studies demonstrated that oral exposure, the most likely route for fly-to-chicken transmission, required an NDV (Roakin) dose ≥10(6) ID(50). These results indicate that house flies are capable of harboring NDV (Roakin) but that they are poor vectors of the virus because they carry an insufficient virus titer to cause infection.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Live attenuated viruses have been developed and used to help protect humans from various infectious diseases. Live attenuated vaccine viruses simulate natural infection and are highly immunogenic and effective in inducing both humoral and cellular immune responses. Because of their demonstrated safety and effectiveness against infectious diseases, different live attenuated vaccine viruses have been explored as vectors to express heterologous antigens [1]. Measles vaccine (MV) strain has a long history of demonstrated safety in humans. It induces long lasting immunity including antibody and T cell responses [2-4]. Aerosol administration of measles vaccine is also being developed and has been shown to induce similar or better immunogenicity compared to conventional subcutaneous or intramuscular vaccination [5, 6]. This aerosol administration route may offer advantages in helping to protect individuals from mucosal pathogens.\\nThe development of reverse genetics for negative stranded RNA viruses including measles virus has made it possible to explore the utility of the negative stranded RNA viruses to deliver foreign antigens. Measles vaccine virus has been explored by several laboratories to express foreign antigens such as the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS coronavirus, HIV gp160, HPV L1 and hepatitis B surface antigens [7-10]. The vectored MV induces robust antibody and T cell responses against both insert antigens and MV [7-18], making it an attractive option for vaccination against measles as well as other infectious agents. Although some studies showed that MV could boost measles virus immune response in school aged children who had previously received measles vaccine [19, 20], the pre-existing immunity to measles virus may reduce the immunogenicity of the vectored measles vaccine [21, 22]. Thus, the utility of MV vector in measles seropositive population remains to be determined. Several studies performed in the early 1980s in developing countries revealed that high seroconversion rates were achieved with EZ measles vaccine despite the presence of high titer of maternal measles virus antibody [23]. Therefore, the EZ strain might be immunogenic in populations with histories of measles vaccination or preexisting MV immunity.\\nIn this study, we explored the use of the EZ vaccine strain to deliver viral antigens for prevention of RSV and EBV associated diseases. RSV causes severe lower respiratory tract illness in infants and the elderly. Bronchiolitis from RSV infection in infants is associated with recurrent wheezing and asthma in childhood [24]. No vaccine is available to prevent morbidity and mortality from RSV infection. The surface fusion (F) protein of RSV is a major antigenic protein that induces neutralizing antibodies, CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and protection against subsequent RSV challenge in mice or cotton rats [25]. High levels of F neutralizing antibodies are sufficient to protect the lower respiratory tract infection [26] and have been used for prophylactic purpose in infants.\\nEBV is a gamma herpes virus that causes infectious mononucleosis in adolescents [27]. In addition, EBV has been associated with certain malignancies including Burkitt’s lymphoma, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease, lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma [28]. There is no prophylactic EBV vaccine available. The surface glycoprotein gp350, which binds to human CD21 receptor on B cells to mediate viral entry, has been identified as a protective antigen. The adjuvanted EBV gp350 protein has been shown to be efficacious in a randomized phase II study in preventing infectious mononucleosis [29]. Here, we report the construction of an infectious measles virus by reverse genetics system and the insertion of the F protein of respiratory syncytial virus or gp350 of EBV into MV virus as a separate transcriptional unit. The vectored viruses were then evaluated in cotton rats and rhesus macaques for their immunogenicity.\\nRSV A2 strain was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, MA). EZ vaccine strain was from Serum Institute of India (Pune, India). Vero and HEp-2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagles’s medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2mM L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C with 5% CO2.\\nAntigenomic cDNA was synthesized by DNA2.0 (Menlo Park, CA) based on the sequence of live attenuated measles virus Edmonston-Zagreb strain (NCBI DNA accession number F266290). The T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence was added to the 5’ end of the antigenomic cDNA and the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme and a T7 RNA polymerase terminator sequences were added to the 3’ end of the antigenomic cDNA. Sequence at nucleotides 5502 (Sca I) and 9343 (Mlu I) was modified to facilitate cDNA cloning. The three amino acid residues at positions 3682, 3862 and 10555 (3682K→R, 3862S→N, 10555K→R) that were different from the EZ vaccine strains were corrected by site-directed mutagenesis. The MV antigenomic cDNA was cloned into pUC18 vector and denoted as pEZ (Fig. 1). Supporting plasmids encoding measles N, P and L genes were cloned into pCITE plasmids under the control of T7 promoter as previously described and were designed pN, pP and pL respectively [30].\\nThe ectodomain of RSV F and EBV gp350 ectodomains were inserted into the non-coding region 3' proximal of the N gene or in the junction between the P and M genes of pEZ (Fig. 1). Each inserted gene contained measles virus transcriptional unit consisting of the sequences of N gene stop (GE-N) and P gene start (GS-P). To insert the RSV F gene into the promoter proximal location, a pUC-SnaBI/SacII (pUC-S/S) subclone that contained the T7 promoter and MV sequence of 1 to 2044 with a silent mutation at nt 821 to knockout EcoRV enzyme site was generated. A gene cassette containing the ectodomain of RSV-F (aa 1-524) followed by GE-N and GS-P sequence were inserted into EcoRV site at nt 99. The genomic DNA was in multiples of 6 nucleotides (the rule of six). The SnaB I-Sac II fragment was swiped back to pEZ antigenomic cDNA (Fig. 1A) and the resulting cDNA was denoted as pEZ-RSVsF1.\\nTo insert the RSV F gene and EBV gp350 gene into pEZ between the P and M genes, a pUC-SacII/NarI (pUC-S/N) subclone that contained the MV sequence of 2045 nt to 4924 nt was constructed. A gene cassette containing gene end (GE) of N, gene start (GS) of P and ectodomain of RSV-F (aa 1-524), full length (aa 1 -861) or truncated (aa 1-470) ectodomain of gp350 at SpeI site (nt 3372). The Sac II to Nar I fragment was swiped back to pEZ antigenomic cDNA (Fig. 1A) and the resulting cDNA was denoted as pEZ-RSVsF3, pEZ-EBVgp350 and pEZ-EBVgp350tr respectively.\\nRescue of the recombinant viruses from MV antigenomic cDNA was performed as previously described [16, 30, 31]. Briefly, HEp-2 cells were infected with MVA-T7 at a multiplicity of infectivity (moi) of 5 for an hour prior to transfection. A DNA mixture of pEZ (0.8 μg), pN (0.4 μg), pP (0.4 μg) and pL (0.2 μg) were co-transfected into MVA-T7 infected HEp-2 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The culture medium was replaced with DMEM containing 2% FBS after overnight incubation at 37oC. The transfected cells were incubated for an additional 3 to 4 days and the culture supernatant was used to infect fresh Vero cells to amplify the rescued virus. The rescued viruses were then plaque purified twice in Vero cells. The viruses rescued from pEZ, pEZ-RSVsF1, pEZ-RSVsF3, pEZ-EBVgp350 and pEZ-EBVgp350tr were designated as rEZ, sF1, sF3, gp350 and gp350tr, respectively.\\nReplication kinetics of rEZ, gp350, gp350tr, sF1 or sF3 viruses was compared in Vero cells. Vero cells in six-well plates were infected with each virus at a MOI of 0.01 in triplicates. After a 1 hour adsorption at room temperature, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with 2 mL of complete DMEM at 35oC with 5% CO2. Aliquots of culture supernatant were collected daily from each well for 7 days and stored at -80oC until virus titration. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay in Vero cells as previously described [32]. Replication kinetic was performed twice in triplicate and each supernatant sample was titered in duplicate.\\nVero cells were infected at a MOI of 3.0 with rEZ, gp350, gp350tr, sF1 or sF3 for 18 hours at 37°C. Culture supernatant and cells were harvested separately. The cells were scraped and pelleted for 10 sec at 6,000 rpm in microfuge tubes and lysed in lysis buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% [vol/vol] protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 8.0) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 10 min on ice. The resulting cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min.\\nProteins from culture supernatant or cell lysates were separated by electrophoresis and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. Viral proteins were detected with anti-measles nucleoprotein (clone 2D7, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal rabbit EBV gp350 [33] or monoclonal antibody against RSV F proteins (palivizumab, MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD) antibodies. Intensities of the bands were quantified by ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Relative intensity was determined by comparing pixel intensity of the band relative to the rEZ control.\\nSpecific-pathogen-free 6- to 8-week-old cotton rats were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). The animal study protocol was approved by MedImmune’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane by inhalation and vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) with 105 PFU of rEZ, gp350tr, gp350, sF1 or sF3 in a 200 μl inoculum volume. The control groups were inoculated intramuscularly (i.m) with PBS, 105 PFU of UV-inactivated sF3, or intransally (i.n) with 106 PFU of RSV A2 strain. The animals were boosted with the same dose of viruses 4 weeks later.\\nThe animals were observed for clinical signs daily and bled at 14-day intervals to measure antibody responses. Twenty-eight days after the second immunization, the cotton rats from measles virus vectored RSV vaccine groups were challenged with 106 PFU of RSV A2 strain i.n. The lungs were harvested on day 4 post-challenge and viral titers were determined by plaque assay.\\nAdult rhesus macaques aged 3-9 year-old were used for the immunogenicity study at Valley Biosystems (West Sacramento, CA). All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee at MedImmune and Valley Biosystems. Measles vaccine immunization history of the rhesus macaques was confirmed by neutralization assay prior to the study. A total of 16 rhesus macaques (8 measles virus seropositive, 8 naïve) were used in the study. Half of the animals (4 measles virus sero-positive, 4 naïve) received two doses of gp350 intramuscularly using 105 PFU/inoculation and the other half received two doses of sF3 at the same dose intramuscularly. The inoculations were performed at 4 week intervals. Blood was drawn from each animal every 14 days to assess immune responses. Animals were anesthetized with ketamine intramuscularly at each procedure. Clinical symptoms were monitored by veterinarians for the duration of the study.\\nEBV gp350- or RSV F-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed to determine the levels of gp350 or F protein-specific antibodies. Briefly, 100 ng of purified recombinant soluble EBV gp350 or RSV F protein expressed from mammalian cells was adsorbed onto Immulon 2B plates overnight in PBS at 4°C. The plate was blocked with 5% BSA in PBS. Serial dilutions of animal sera in PBS/1%BSA were added to the plate and incubated for an hour at room temperature. After washing, HRP-conjugated anti-cotton rat IgG (Immunology Consultants Laboratory, Newberg, OR) or anti-rhesus macaques IgG (Rockland Immunochemicals, Boyertown, PA) were added and incubated for 1 hour. Finally, the plate was developed with tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase substrate (KPL, Rockford, IL) and stopped with HCl. Absorbances of the samples were read at 450 nm and the titer for each sample was calculated by determining the dilution at which the absorbance reached 2 times over the reading of no serum control. The lower limits of detection were 3.3 log2 and 6.6 log2 for EBV gp350 ELISA and RSV F ELISA, respectively.\\nMeasles virus specific neutralizing antibodies were determined as described previously [34] in 96-well plates using Vero cells. Neutralizing antibody titer is defined as the highest dilution that inhibits 50% CPE. RSV specific neutralizing antibody was determined by the plaque reduction neutralization assay as described previously [35]. The lower limit of detection was 4.3 log2 and 3.0 log2 for MV microneutralization and RSV plaque reduction assays, respectively. EBV specific neutralizing antibody titer was determined by the method described by Sashihara et al.,[36].\\nELISpot assays were performed with spleens from vaccinated and control cotton rats 14 days after the second dose and peripheral blood mononucleocyte cells (PBMC) of rhesus monkeys 28 days after the second dose. Splenocytes were isolated as previously described [37]. Splenocytes were counted using Vi-Cell (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and Interleukin 4-secreting T cells were quantified in an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay using R&amp;D DuoSet ELISA System for cotton rat IFN-γ and IL-4 antibodies (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) as previously described using 10 μg/mL of EBV gp350 or RSV F proteins for stimulation [38]. Spots were scanned and counted by ImmunoSpot spot Analyzer (Cellular Technology, Cleveland, OH). The numbers of IFN-γ or IL-4 secreting cells were expressed as the number cells per 106 cells.\\nGraphPad Prism software was used to analyze the data (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). All data were expressed as the mean and standard error. The data were also analyzed by Mann-Whitney rank sum test to compare data distribution between any two experimental groups. Titer comparison between viruses in replication kinetic experiment was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, assuming non-parametric distribution.\\nThe reverse genetics system for measles Edmonston-Zagreb (EZ) vaccine virus was established by transfecting \\nMV antigenomic plasmid pEZ together with pP, pN and pL into MVA-T7 infected HEp-2 cells to recover infectious EZ virus. To generate rEZ expressing RSV F or EBV gp350, the F ectodomain of RSV and EBV gp350 were cloned into the MV antigenomic cDNA (Fig. 1A). The F was cloned at the two positions of the viral genome: one proximal to the N gene (1st position) and the other between the P and M genes (3rd position). EBV gp350 ectodomain and its N-terminal half of the gp350 (amino acid 1-470, gp350tr) that encoded the receptor binding site to CD21 [39] were also cloned into the EZ genome at the 1st and 3rd positions. Recombinant EZ with RSV F, EBV gp350 and EBV gp350tr inserted at the 1st or 3rd position were generated. However, viruses with gp350 and gp350tr inserted at the 1st position replicated poorly in vitro and were not evaluated further. The rescued recombinant viruses expressing RSV F or EBV gp350 or gp350tr were designed as sF1 (F at the 1st position), sF3 (F at the 3rd position), gp350 and gp350tr (both at the 3rd position), respectively.\\nTo confirm that these recombinant measles viruses expressed the desired antigens, the expression of the inserts in infected Vero cells was examined by Western blotting analysis. In addition to MV N protein that was detected in infected cell lysate (Fig. 1B), RSV F and EBV gp350 were detected in the culture supernatant of the infected cells (Fig. 1B), indicating the production of secreted form of RSV F and EBVgp350 proteins from virus infected cells. The observation of lower MV N expression in Vero cells infected with sF1 compared to other viruses may be attributed to the insertion of RSV F proximal to the MV N gene, which moved the MV N gene to the 2nd position of the genome and reduced its mRNA transcript level. The relative expression of RSV F to MV N, however, was shown to be higher for sF1 compared to sF3. This is consistent with the observation that genes proximal to 3’ end of the genome are transcribed more abundantly than those downstream and more RSV F was produced from sF1 than sF3 per virion.\\nViral replication efficiency of these recombinant viruses was assessed by growth kinetics in Vero cells. Both recombinant EZ (rEZ) and EZ vaccine viruses grew to a peak titer of 7.9 log10 PFU/mL on day 5 (Fig. 3A). rEZ with either RSVF (Fig. 2A) or EBVgp350 (Fig. 2B) inserts had comparable growth kinetics but slightly lower (between 0.1-0.7 log10 lower) than rEZ. The peak titers between the viruses were not statistically different. sF3 had a faster growth kinetics and reached peak titer on day 3 instead of day 5. Therefore, insertion of RSV F or EBV gp350 into the genome of EZ did not significantly reduce viral growth in vitro.\\nCotton rats had previously been demonstrated to be semi-permissive to measles virus infection [40] and are the best available small animal model for MV infection. In addition, cotton rats are susceptible to RSV infection and have been used in the evaluation of RSV vaccines [41, 42] and anti-RSV antibody investigated for prophylactic application [43]. The ability of rEZ vectored vaccines to induce humoral responses to measles virus and RSV F or EBV gp350 protein were assessed in cotton rats. Cotton rats were immunized \\nwith two doses of rEZ viruses intramuscularly at 4 weeks interval. Sera were collected 4 weeks post dose 1 and 2 weeks post dose 2. Measles virus neutralizing antibodies (MV Ab) were induced rapidly after one dose administration, reaching titers of 6.3-8.7 log2. No significant differences in MV Ab titers were observed among the animals receiving sF1, sF3, gp350 or gp350tr compared to rEZ. The 2nd dose increased MV Ab titers by 2-4 folds (Table 1). The control animals vaccinated with UV-inactivated sF3 or RSV A2 virus did not have detectable MV Ab titer (data not shown).\\nRSV-specific antibody responses were measured by RSV F-specific ELISA and microneutralization assay. sF1 or sF3 induced RSV F-specific IgG antibody in the vaccinated cotton rats (about 15.5-15.9 log2 post dose 1 and 22.1-23.7 log2 post dose 2). The RSV F-specific IgG antibody titers were similar between the sF1 and sF3 vaccinated groups. RSV neutralizing antibody titers were also measured against RSV A2 strain. After the first dose, sF1 and sF3 induced RSV neutralizing Ab and titers were boosted to 7.5-log2 and 8.9-log2 after the second dose (Table 1). There was no statistical difference in antibody response between sF1 and sF3 vaccinated animals and those intranasally infected with 2 doses of RSV A2 strain (9.4 log2 ± 1.5, data not shown). Animals vaccinated with UV-inactivated sF3 did not have detectable RSV antibody (data not shown), indicating that virus immunogenicity was dependent on live virus infection.\\nEBV-specific antibody response was measured by EBV gp350-specific ELISA assay. EBV specific ELISA Ab response was detected after one dose administrations of gp350 or gp350tr; after the 2nd dose the titers reached 7.3 and 4.3 log2 for gp350 and gp350tr vaccinated animals, respectively (Table 1). Gp350 induced a significantly higher EBV gp350-specific IgG titer than gp350tr. EBV specific neutralizing antibody could not be detected by the EBV neutralization assay.\\nCell mediated immune response is important for viral clearance and may play an important role in vaccine mediated protective immune response [44]. RSV F-specific and EBV gp350-specific T cell responses in splenocytes were examined by IFN-γ and IL-4 ELISpot on day 7 post the 2nd dose. The frequencies of RSV F-specific IFN-γ secreting cells were statistically higher in sF3 vaccinated group (average 130 spots/106 splenocytes) compared to sF1 vaccinated (average 9 spots/106 splenocytes) or RSV A2-infected animals (average 45 spots/106 splenocytes) (Fig. 3A). The RSV F-specific IL-4 secreting cells were low, averaged about 20 spots/106 splenocytes for both sF1 and sF3 groups. Surprisingly, no RSV-specific IL-4 secreting cells detected in RSV A2-infected animals (Fig. 3C). Thus, sF3 and RSV induced a Th1-biased response based on the higher IFN-γ to IL-4 secreting cell ratio.\\nThe frequencies of EBV gp350-specific IFN-γ and IL-4 secreting cells for gp350 (average 23 spots and 15 spots/106 splenocytes for IFN-γ and IL-4 respectively) and gp350tr vaccinated groups (average 49 spots and 41 spots/106 splenocytes for IFN-γ and IL-4 respectively) were not statistically different, but were statistically higher than the PBS control group for the gp350tr group (Fig. 3B, D).\\nAnimal model is not available for assessing EBV vaccine induced protective immune response. Cotton rat is the best available small animal model to evaluate RSV vaccine induced protection against wt RSV challenge infection. To assess if the immune responses induced from sF1 and sF3 could provide protection against RSV A2 challenge, vaccinated cotton rats were challenged with RSV A2 intranasally and virus titers in the lungs were measured. Similar to RSV infected animals, sF1 or sF3 offered complete protection against RSV A2 challenge with viral titers in the lungs that was at least 4.5 log10 lower than the control animals. In contrast, cotton rats vaccinated with 105 PFU of UV-inactivated sF3 had viral titer similar to the PBS control group, indicating that viral replication is necessary for induction of protective immune response (Fig. 4).\\nRhesus macaques are fully permissive to measles virus infection and have been used for evaluation of measles vaccine and measles virus pathogenesis studies [45-47]. The ability of rEZ vectored RSV F and EBV gp350 to induce measles virus specific or F or gp350 specific immune responses was examined in this more permissive animal model. Since sF3 demonstrated better immunogenicity than sF1 in cotton rats, only sF3 was evaluated in measles virus seropositive (MV+) rhesus macaques that had prior measles vaccination and measles virus seronegative (MV-) rhesus macaques. No abnormal clinical signs were observed and serum chemistries were within the normal range in all monkeys throughout the study (data not shown). sF3 or gp350 vaccinated monkeys induced a similar level of MV neutralizing antibody in both MV- and MV+ monkeys. A second dose of vaccination with sF3 or gp350 increased MV neutralizing Ab titers by about 4-fold in all groups (Table 2). The Ab titer differences between the groups were not statistically significant.\\nAntibody responses to the inserted genes, however, were relatively low. sF3 inoculated animals had RSV F-specific IgG titer higher than the pre-vaccination level (titers were under the detection limit). F specific IgG Ab titers were 9.3 log2 and 8.8 log2 in MV+ and MV- groups after dose 1, respectively. After a second dose, three out of 4 animals in MV+ group had more than 4-fold increase in RSV F-specific IgG Ab titer but none of the animals in MV- group had 4-fold increase in Ab response (Fig. 5A). After two doses of vaccination, RSV neutralizing Ab titers in all groups were very low in both MV+ and MV- groups. Seven out of 8 animals had a detectable level of RSV neutralizing Ab. The RSV Nt Ab titers were not statistically different between the two groups (5.0 log2 for MV+ versus 4.5 log2 for MV- groups) (Table 2). Ab responses to EBV gp350 in the gp350 vaccinated monkeys were not detected at all time points. Similar to antibody responses, IFN-γ secreting cells in PBMC to measles viral antigens were significantly higher (~10-fold) than the responses to either RSV F or EBV gp350 (Fig. 5B) while PBMC, when stimulated with measles viral antigens, RSV F or EBV gp350, did not secrete any IL-4. Thus, compared to the cotton rat studies, rEZ vectored viruses were poorly immunogenic in the primate model.\\nReverse genetics has been developed for generating recombinant measles virus vectored vaccines encoding foreign antigens based on the Edmonston-Schwarz and AIK-C vaccine strain [15, 48]. The reverse genetic system described in this study was based on the EZ vaccine strain, which is used predominantly outside the US. The EZ strain might be immunogenic in population that has prior measles vaccine immunization [23]. The ectodomains of the RSV F and EBV gp350 glycoproteins instead of full length proteins were engineered to be expressed by EZ to avoid the incorporation of the foreign surface glycoproteins onto the measles virus envelope. The expression of heterologous membrane proteins on measles virus surface may alter the binding of measles to its natural receptors and thus change the tissue tropism of measles virus. We showed that both RSV F and EBV gp350 was expressed efficiently in vitro. However, rEZ vectored vaccines induced insert specific responses in cotton rats but poor responses in rhesus macaques although both cotton rats and rhesus macaques have previously been shown to be permissive to measles virus infection to various degrees [47, 49-51].\\nOne of the important determinants for inducing a robust immune response in vivo is the amount of the expressed antigen level and antigen presentation. We have evaluated the effect of the gene insertion location and antigen expression level because transcription of nonsegmented negative strand RNA viruses is obligatorily sequential [52]. The genes located at proximal to the 3’ promoter are produced more abundantly than the ones distal to the promoter [53]. Indeed, when RSV F was introduced 3’ proximally to the N gene, it produced 10 times more secreted RSV F protein than when inserted between the P and M junction (data not shown). In comparison, insertion of the gp350 of EBV at the 1st position of EZ significantly affected virus replication. Insertion of the EBV gp350 gene between the P and M genes had less effect on virus growth, similar to that shown for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (14). The gene insertion position affected immunogenicity of EZ vectored vaccines in cotton rats. rEZ encoding RSV F ectodomain induced antibody response against measles and RSV F. rEZ-sF3 induced MV specific antibody response comparable to rEZ and RSV specific Ab response comparable to those induced by intranasal RSV infection in cotton rats; it also induced cell mediated response as measured by IFN-γ ELISpot assay. Surprisingly, sF1 was inferior to sF3 in its ability to induce both RSV neutralizing antibody and RSV F-specific IFN-γ secreting T cell responses, suggesting that sF1 may be more attenuated than sF3 in vivo. Immune response is dependent on viral infectivity and the nature of the inserts. rEZ vectored EBV gp350 and gp350tr induced lower gp350 specific IgG Ab response and undetectable neutralizing antibody response in cotton rats.\\nThe cotton rats immunized with MV expressing RSV F were also challenged with wt RSV. After challenge, the number of IFN-γ secreting cells was higher than IL-4 secreting cells, which was consistent with a Th1-biased response (data not shown). RSV enhanced disease has been associated with FI-RSV vaccine [54, 55]. A chimeric parainfluenza virus vectored RSV F [35] did not cause enhanced disease in hamsters and has been proven to be safe in phase I clinical trial in seronegative children [56]. Recently, a report from another group has shown that measles virus vectored RSV F did not cause unusual pathology in cotton rats after RSV challenge, thus, the likelihood of the MV vector F to cause enhanced disease is very low [15].\\nSince cotton rats are partially permissive to MV, MV vectored vaccine was further evaluated in rhesus macaques. Rhesus macaque is fully permissive to measles virus infection and the infected monkeys develop symptoms similar to those experienced by humans, such as skin rash, fever and conjunctivitis [47]. This monkey model was used in the neurovirulence testing of MV vaccine [57]. In addition, since rhesus macaques could be infected with human measles virus, the breeding colony is commonly vaccinated with MV. This allowed us to examine the effect of prior vaccination on vectored measles and mimic our target populations that either have maternal antibodies or have measles vaccination history. rEZ and rEZ expressing gp350 and sF3 induced a good level of antibody response to measles virus irrespective of their sero-status to MV. The antibody response was slightly lower in magnitude than what were observed in the cotton rats as the dose per kg used in the rhesus was ~ 90 times lower than in cotton rats. The antibody response to the F and gp350 inserts was much lower in rhesus macaques. A previous report showed that two doses of MV-HIV gp140 at 5x106 TCID50 (25 times higher dose than our study) induced a robust Ab response towards HIV gp140 in monkeys [10]. However, three doses of 104 TCID50 (1/15 our dose) of MV vectored HBV surface antigen induced a very low response in monkeys [14]. Thus, the low humoral responses to the vectored inserts in rhesus macaques may be due to a lower dose used in this study.\\nMeasles vaccine virus has been shown to bind signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM; also known as CD150) on activated immune cells and CD46 [58], which is ubiquitously expressed on human cells. It is thought that virus infects the respiratory tract through SLAM on dendritic cells. In cotton rats, although human CD46 and CD150 homologs have not been reported [59], measles virus could replicate in the lungs of these animals after intranasal infection [40]. We have evaluated different routes of administration (both intranasal and intramuscular) of MV vectored RSV F in cotton rats and found that both inoculation routes offered protection against RSV challenge after immunization (data not shown). Rhesus macaques possess both CD46 and CD150 receptor homologs [60] and are susceptible to measles virus infection and develop diseases similar to humans. The difference in receptors between the two animal species may be able to explain why insertion of the insert into EZ strain have further attenuated viruses and reduced immunogenicity of the virus in rhesus macaques but not in cotton rats.\\nWe also examined replication of EZ vectored RSV F and EBV gp350 in vivo by using real time qRT-PCR since differential in growth kinetics of recombinant measles virus may explain the difference in antibody responses. However, we were not able to detect measles genomes in PBMC isolated from whole blood 24 hours post vaccination. This may be attributed to the low copies of measles virus circulating in the blood or the time point used to measure measles kinetics in vivo was not optimal. In conjunction, we have examined replication of EZ vectors in PBMC of rhesus macaques ex vivo to determine if insertion of the foreign gene affected replication of these viruses in PBMC. PHA-activated PBMC cells were infected with rMV at MOI of 1.0 and growth kinetics were determined for 7 days. The peak titer of the recombinant viruses containing RSV F or EBV gp350 were only 0.5 log10 lower than rEZ (data not shown), indicating the vectored vaccine could infect rhesus cells. We also investigated genetic stability of the insert by serially passaging the recombinant viruses in Vero cells 10 times and did not find the loss of the inserted gene expression as reported previously [61, 62].\\nOther negative stranded RNA viruses including Newcastle disease virus (NDV), vesicular stomatitis virus, Sendai virus and parainfluenza viruses [35, 63-65] had been evaluated as vectors to deliver foreign antigens and were shown to elicit both humoral and cellular responses in non-human primates and to confer protection to virus challenge in some cases [63, 66-69]. The vectored vaccines were normally delivered to non-human primates by either intranasal or intratracheal inoculation route. We found intranasal and intramuscular vaccination of EZ induced similar antibody response in cotton rats. It is possible that intranasal immunization might be more immunogenic than intramuscular vaccination in monkeys.\\nBased on our study, MV vector is probably not suitable for delivery of the EBV gp350 antigen. Immunogenicity of adjuvanted gp350 protein vaccine has been demonstrated in young adults [29], adjvanted gp350 might be the right approach for EBV vaccine development. The amount of gp350 delivered by MV is likely not sufficient to induce gp350 specific immune response. The F protein of RSV delivered by MV is more immunogenic than EBV gp350, however, additional evaluation of immunogenicity of MV-RSV F must be conduced before proceeding to testing this vaccine in humans.</td>\n",
              "      <td>RSV A2 strain was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, MA). EZ vaccine strain was from Serum Institute of India (Pune, India). Vero and HEp-2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagles’s medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2mM L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C with 5% CO2.\\nAntigenomic cDNA was synthesized by DNA2.0 (Menlo Park, CA) based on the sequence of live attenuated measles virus Edmonston-Zagreb strain (NCBI DNA accession number F266290). The T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence was added to the 5’ end of the antigenomic cDNA and the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme and a T7 RNA polymerase terminator sequences were added to the 3’ end of the antigenomic cDNA. Sequence at nucleotides 5502 (Sca I) and 9343 (Mlu I) was modified to facilitate cDNA cloning. The three amino acid residues at positions 3682, 3862 and 10555 (3682K→R, 3862S→N, 10555K→R) that were different from the EZ vaccine strains were corrected by site-directed mutagenesis. The MV antigenomic cDNA was cloned into pUC18 vector and denoted as pEZ (Fig. 1). Supporting plasmids encoding measles N, P and L genes were cloned into pCITE plasmids under the control of T7 promoter as previously described and were designed pN, pP and pL respectively [30].\\nThe ectodomain of RSV F and EBV gp350 ectodomains were inserted into the non-coding region 3' proximal of the N gene or in the junction between the P and M genes of pEZ (Fig. 1). Each inserted gene contained measles virus transcriptional unit consisting of the sequences of N gene stop (GE-N) and P gene start (GS-P). To insert the RSV F gene into the promoter proximal location, a pUC-SnaBI/SacII (pUC-S/S) subclone that contained the T7 promoter and MV sequence of 1 to 2044 with a silent mutation at nt 821 to knockout EcoRV enzyme site was generated. A gene cassette containing the ectodomain of RSV-F (aa 1-524) followed by GE-N and GS-P sequence were inserted into EcoRV site at nt 99. The genomic DNA was in multiples of 6 nucleotides (the rule of six). The SnaB I-Sac II fragment was swiped back to pEZ antigenomic cDNA (Fig. 1A) and the resulting cDNA was denoted as pEZ-RSVsF1.\\nTo insert the RSV F gene and EBV gp350 gene into pEZ between the P and M genes, a pUC-SacII/NarI (pUC-S/N) subclone that contained the MV sequence of 2045 nt to 4924 nt was constructed. A gene cassette containing gene end (GE) of N, gene start (GS) of P and ectodomain of RSV-F (aa 1-524), full length (aa 1 -861) or truncated (aa 1-470) ectodomain of gp350 at SpeI site (nt 3372). The Sac II to Nar I fragment was swiped back to pEZ antigenomic cDNA (Fig. 1A) and the resulting cDNA was denoted as pEZ-RSVsF3, pEZ-EBVgp350 and pEZ-EBVgp350tr respectively.\\nRescue of the recombinant viruses from MV antigenomic cDNA was performed as previously described [16, 30, 31]. Briefly, HEp-2 cells were infected with MVA-T7 at a multiplicity of infectivity (moi) of 5 for an hour prior to transfection. A DNA mixture of pEZ (0.8 μg), pN (0.4 μg), pP (0.4 μg) and pL (0.2 μg) were co-transfected into MVA-T7 infected HEp-2 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The culture medium was replaced with DMEM containing 2% FBS after overnight incubation at 37oC. The transfected cells were incubated for an additional 3 to 4 days and the culture supernatant was used to infect fresh Vero cells to amplify the rescued virus. The rescued viruses were then plaque purified twice in Vero cells. The viruses rescued from pEZ, pEZ-RSVsF1, pEZ-RSVsF3, pEZ-EBVgp350 and pEZ-EBVgp350tr were designated as rEZ, sF1, sF3, gp350 and gp350tr, respectively.\\nReplication kinetics of rEZ, gp350, gp350tr, sF1 or sF3 viruses was compared in Vero cells. Vero cells in six-well plates were infected with each virus at a MOI of 0.01 in triplicates. After a 1 hour adsorption at room temperature, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with 2 mL of complete DMEM at 35oC with 5% CO2. Aliquots of culture supernatant were collected daily from each well for 7 days and stored at -80oC until virus titration. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay in Vero cells as previously described [32]. Replication kinetic was performed twice in triplicate and each supernatant sample was titered in duplicate.\\nVero cells were infected at a MOI of 3.0 with rEZ, gp350, gp350tr, sF1 or sF3 for 18 hours at 37°C. Culture supernatant and cells were harvested separately. The cells were scraped and pelleted for 10 sec at 6,000 rpm in microfuge tubes and lysed in lysis buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% [vol/vol] protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 8.0) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 10 min on ice. The resulting cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min.\\nProteins from culture supernatant or cell lysates were separated by electrophoresis and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. Viral proteins were detected with anti-measles nucleoprotein (clone 2D7, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal rabbit EBV gp350 [33] or monoclonal antibody against RSV F proteins (palivizumab, MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD) antibodies. Intensities of the bands were quantified by ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Relative intensity was determined by comparing pixel intensity of the band relative to the rEZ control.\\nSpecific-pathogen-free 6- to 8-week-old cotton rats were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). The animal study protocol was approved by MedImmune’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane by inhalation and vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) with 105 PFU of rEZ, gp350tr, gp350, sF1 or sF3 in a 200 μl inoculum volume. The control groups were inoculated intramuscularly (i.m) with PBS, 105 PFU of UV-inactivated sF3, or intransally (i.n) with 106 PFU of RSV A2 strain. The animals were boosted with the same dose of viruses 4 weeks later.\\nThe animals were observed for clinical signs daily and bled at 14-day intervals to measure antibody responses. Twenty-eight days after the second immunization, the cotton rats from measles virus vectored RSV vaccine groups were challenged with 106 PFU of RSV A2 strain i.n. The lungs were harvested on day 4 post-challenge and viral titers were determined by plaque assay.\\nAdult rhesus macaques aged 3-9 year-old were used for the immunogenicity study at Valley Biosystems (West Sacramento, CA). All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee at MedImmune and Valley Biosystems. Measles vaccine immunization history of the rhesus macaques was confirmed by neutralization assay prior to the study. A total of 16 rhesus macaques (8 measles virus seropositive, 8 naïve) were used in the study. Half of the animals (4 measles virus sero-positive, 4 naïve) received two doses of gp350 intramuscularly using 105 PFU/inoculation and the other half received two doses of sF3 at the same dose intramuscularly. The inoculations were performed at 4 week intervals. Blood was drawn from each animal every 14 days to assess immune responses. Animals were anesthetized with ketamine intramuscularly at each procedure. Clinical symptoms were monitored by veterinarians for the duration of the study.\\nEBV gp350- or RSV F-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed to determine the levels of gp350 or F protein-specific antibodies. Briefly, 100 ng of purified recombinant soluble EBV gp350 or RSV F protein expressed from mammalian cells was adsorbed onto Immulon 2B plates overnight in PBS at 4°C. The plate was blocked with 5% BSA in PBS. Serial dilutions of animal sera in PBS/1%BSA were added to the plate and incubated for an hour at room temperature. After washing, HRP-conjugated anti-cotton rat IgG (Immunology Consultants Laboratory, Newberg, OR) or anti-rhesus macaques IgG (Rockland Immunochemicals, Boyertown, PA) were added and incubated for 1 hour. Finally, the plate was developed with tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase substrate (KPL, Rockford, IL) and stopped with HCl. Absorbances of the samples were read at 450 nm and the titer for each sample was calculated by determining the dilution at which the absorbance reached 2 times over the reading of no serum control. The lower limits of detection were 3.3 log2 and 6.6 log2 for EBV gp350 ELISA and RSV F ELISA, respectively.\\nMeasles virus specific neutralizing antibodies were determined as described previously [34] in 96-well plates using Vero cells. Neutralizing antibody titer is defined as the highest dilution that inhibits 50% CPE. RSV specific neutralizing antibody was determined by the plaque reduction neutralization assay as described previously [35]. The lower limit of detection was 4.3 log2 and 3.0 log2 for MV microneutralization and RSV plaque reduction assays, respectively. EBV specific neutralizing antibody titer was determined by the method described by Sashihara et al.,[36].\\nELISpot assays were performed with spleens from vaccinated and control cotton rats 14 days after the second dose and peripheral blood mononucleocyte cells (PBMC) of rhesus monkeys 28 days after the second dose. Splenocytes were isolated as previously described [37]. Splenocytes were counted using Vi-Cell (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and Interleukin 4-secreting T cells were quantified in an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay using R&amp;D DuoSet ELISA System for cotton rat IFN-γ and IL-4 antibodies (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) as previously described using 10 μg/mL of EBV gp350 or RSV F proteins for stimulation [38]. Spots were scanned and counted by ImmunoSpot spot Analyzer (Cellular Technology, Cleveland, OH). The numbers of IFN-γ or IL-4 secreting cells were expressed as the number cells per 106 cells.\\nGraphPad Prism software was used to analyze the data (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). All data were expressed as the mean and standard error. The data were also analyzed by Mann-Whitney rank sum test to compare data distribution between any two experimental groups. Titer comparison between viruses in replication kinetic experiment was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, assuming non-parametric distribution.</td>\n",
              "      <td>The reverse genetics system for measles Edmonston-Zagreb (EZ) vaccine virus was established by transfecting \\nMV antigenomic plasmid pEZ together with pP, pN and pL into MVA-T7 infected HEp-2 cells to recover infectious EZ virus. To generate rEZ expressing RSV F or EBV gp350, the F ectodomain of RSV and EBV gp350 were cloned into the MV antigenomic cDNA (Fig. 1A). The F was cloned at the two positions of the viral genome: one proximal to the N gene (1st position) and the other between the P and M genes (3rd position). EBV gp350 ectodomain and its N-terminal half of the gp350 (amino acid 1-470, gp350tr) that encoded the receptor binding site to CD21 [39] were also cloned into the EZ genome at the 1st and 3rd positions. Recombinant EZ with RSV F, EBV gp350 and EBV gp350tr inserted at the 1st or 3rd position were generated. However, viruses with gp350 and gp350tr inserted at the 1st position replicated poorly in vitro and were not evaluated further. The rescued recombinant viruses expressing RSV F or EBV gp350 or gp350tr were designed as sF1 (F at the 1st position), sF3 (F at the 3rd position), gp350 and gp350tr (both at the 3rd position), respectively.\\nTo confirm that these recombinant measles viruses expressed the desired antigens, the expression of the inserts in infected Vero cells was examined by Western blotting analysis. In addition to MV N protein that was detected in infected cell lysate (Fig. 1B), RSV F and EBV gp350 were detected in the culture supernatant of the infected cells (Fig. 1B), indicating the production of secreted form of RSV F and EBVgp350 proteins from virus infected cells. The observation of lower MV N expression in Vero cells infected with sF1 compared to other viruses may be attributed to the insertion of RSV F proximal to the MV N gene, which moved the MV N gene to the 2nd position of the genome and reduced its mRNA transcript level. The relative expression of RSV F to MV N, however, was shown to be higher for sF1 compared to sF3. This is consistent with the observation that genes proximal to 3’ end of the genome are transcribed more abundantly than those downstream and more RSV F was produced from sF1 than sF3 per virion.\\nViral replication efficiency of these recombinant viruses was assessed by growth kinetics in Vero cells. Both recombinant EZ (rEZ) and EZ vaccine viruses grew to a peak titer of 7.9 log10 PFU/mL on day 5 (Fig. 3A). rEZ with either RSVF (Fig. 2A) or EBVgp350 (Fig. 2B) inserts had comparable growth kinetics but slightly lower (between 0.1-0.7 log10 lower) than rEZ. The peak titers between the viruses were not statistically different. sF3 had a faster growth kinetics and reached peak titer on day 3 instead of day 5. Therefore, insertion of RSV F or EBV gp350 into the genome of EZ did not significantly reduce viral growth in vitro.\\nCotton rats had previously been demonstrated to be semi-permissive to measles virus infection [40] and are the best available small animal model for MV infection. In addition, cotton rats are susceptible to RSV infection and have been used in the evaluation of RSV vaccines [41, 42] and anti-RSV antibody investigated for prophylactic application [43]. The ability of rEZ vectored vaccines to induce humoral responses to measles virus and RSV F or EBV gp350 protein were assessed in cotton rats. Cotton rats were immunized \\nwith two doses of rEZ viruses intramuscularly at 4 weeks interval. Sera were collected 4 weeks post dose 1 and 2 weeks post dose 2. Measles virus neutralizing antibodies (MV Ab) were induced rapidly after one dose administration, reaching titers of 6.3-8.7 log2. No significant differences in MV Ab titers were observed among the animals receiving sF1, sF3, gp350 or gp350tr compared to rEZ. The 2nd dose increased MV Ab titers by 2-4 folds (Table 1). The control animals vaccinated with UV-inactivated sF3 or RSV A2 virus did not have detectable MV Ab titer (data not shown).\\nRSV-specific antibody responses were measured by RSV F-specific ELISA and microneutralization assay. sF1 or sF3 induced RSV F-specific IgG antibody in the vaccinated cotton rats (about 15.5-15.9 log2 post dose 1 and 22.1-23.7 log2 post dose 2). The RSV F-specific IgG antibody titers were similar between the sF1 and sF3 vaccinated groups. RSV neutralizing antibody titers were also measured against RSV A2 strain. After the first dose, sF1 and sF3 induced RSV neutralizing Ab and titers were boosted to 7.5-log2 and 8.9-log2 after the second dose (Table 1). There was no statistical difference in antibody response between sF1 and sF3 vaccinated animals and those intranasally infected with 2 doses of RSV A2 strain (9.4 log2 ± 1.5, data not shown). Animals vaccinated with UV-inactivated sF3 did not have detectable RSV antibody (data not shown), indicating that virus immunogenicity was dependent on live virus infection.\\nEBV-specific antibody response was measured by EBV gp350-specific ELISA assay. EBV specific ELISA Ab response was detected after one dose administrations of gp350 or gp350tr; after the 2nd dose the titers reached 7.3 and 4.3 log2 for gp350 and gp350tr vaccinated animals, respectively (Table 1). Gp350 induced a significantly higher EBV gp350-specific IgG titer than gp350tr. EBV specific neutralizing antibody could not be detected by the EBV neutralization assay.\\nCell mediated immune response is important for viral clearance and may play an important role in vaccine mediated protective immune response [44]. RSV F-specific and EBV gp350-specific T cell responses in splenocytes were examined by IFN-γ and IL-4 ELISpot on day 7 post the 2nd dose. The frequencies of RSV F-specific IFN-γ secreting cells were statistically higher in sF3 vaccinated group (average 130 spots/106 splenocytes) compared to sF1 vaccinated (average 9 spots/106 splenocytes) or RSV A2-infected animals (average 45 spots/106 splenocytes) (Fig. 3A). The RSV F-specific IL-4 secreting cells were low, averaged about 20 spots/106 splenocytes for both sF1 and sF3 groups. Surprisingly, no RSV-specific IL-4 secreting cells detected in RSV A2-infected animals (Fig. 3C). Thus, sF3 and RSV induced a Th1-biased response based on the higher IFN-γ to IL-4 secreting cell ratio.\\nThe frequencies of EBV gp350-specific IFN-γ and IL-4 secreting cells for gp350 (average 23 spots and 15 spots/106 splenocytes for IFN-γ and IL-4 respectively) and gp350tr vaccinated groups (average 49 spots and 41 spots/106 splenocytes for IFN-γ and IL-4 respectively) were not statistically different, but were statistically higher than the PBS control group for the gp350tr group (Fig. 3B, D).\\nAnimal model is not available for assessing EBV vaccine induced protective immune response. Cotton rat is the best available small animal model to evaluate RSV vaccine induced protection against wt RSV challenge infection. To assess if the immune responses induced from sF1 and sF3 could provide protection against RSV A2 challenge, vaccinated cotton rats were challenged with RSV A2 intranasally and virus titers in the lungs were measured. Similar to RSV infected animals, sF1 or sF3 offered complete protection against RSV A2 challenge with viral titers in the lungs that was at least 4.5 log10 lower than the control animals. In contrast, cotton rats vaccinated with 105 PFU of UV-inactivated sF3 had viral titer similar to the PBS control group, indicating that viral replication is necessary for induction of protective immune response (Fig. 4).\\nRhesus macaques are fully permissive to measles virus infection and have been used for evaluation of measles vaccine and measles virus pathogenesis studies [45-47]. The ability of rEZ vectored RSV F and EBV gp350 to induce measles virus specific or F or gp350 specific immune responses was examined in this more permissive animal model. Since sF3 demonstrated better immunogenicity than sF1 in cotton rats, only sF3 was evaluated in measles virus seropositive (MV+) rhesus macaques that had prior measles vaccination and measles virus seronegative (MV-) rhesus macaques. No abnormal clinical signs were observed and serum chemistries were within the normal range in all monkeys throughout the study (data not shown). sF3 or gp350 vaccinated monkeys induced a similar level of MV neutralizing antibody in both MV- and MV+ monkeys. A second dose of vaccination with sF3 or gp350 increased MV neutralizing Ab titers by about 4-fold in all groups (Table 2). The Ab titer differences between the groups were not statistically significant.\\nAntibody responses to the inserted genes, however, were relatively low. sF3 inoculated animals had RSV F-specific IgG titer higher than the pre-vaccination level (titers were under the detection limit). F specific IgG Ab titers were 9.3 log2 and 8.8 log2 in MV+ and MV- groups after dose 1, respectively. After a second dose, three out of 4 animals in MV+ group had more than 4-fold increase in RSV F-specific IgG Ab titer but none of the animals in MV- group had 4-fold increase in Ab response (Fig. 5A). After two doses of vaccination, RSV neutralizing Ab titers in all groups were very low in both MV+ and MV- groups. Seven out of 8 animals had a detectable level of RSV neutralizing Ab. The RSV Nt Ab titers were not statistically different between the two groups (5.0 log2 for MV+ versus 4.5 log2 for MV- groups) (Table 2). Ab responses to EBV gp350 in the gp350 vaccinated monkeys were not detected at all time points. Similar to antibody responses, IFN-γ secreting cells in PBMC to measles viral antigens were significantly higher (~10-fold) than the responses to either RSV F or EBV gp350 (Fig. 5B) while PBMC, when stimulated with measles viral antigens, RSV F or EBV gp350, did not secrete any IL-4. Thus, compared to the cotton rat studies, rEZ vectored viruses were poorly immunogenic in the primate model.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Live attenuated recombinant measles vaccine virus (MV) Edmonston-Zagreb (EZ) strain was evaluated as a viral vector to express the ectodomains of fusion protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV F) or glycoprotein 350 of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV gp350) as candidate vaccines for prophylaxis of RSV and EBV. The glycoprotein gene was inserted at the 1(st) or the 3(rd) position of the measles virus genome and the recombinant viruses were generated. Insertion of the foreign gene at the 3(rd) position had a minimal impact on viral replication in vitro. RSV F or EBV gp350 protein was secreted from infected cells. In cotton rats, EZ-RSV F and EZ-EBV gp350 induced MV- and insert-specific antibody responses. In addition, both vaccines also induced insert specific interferon gamma (IFN-γ) secreting T cell response. EZ-RSV F protected cotton rats from pulmonary replication of RSV A2 challenge infection. In rhesus macaques, although both EZ-RSV F and EZ-EBV gp350 induced MV specific neutralizing antibody responses, only RSV F specific antibody response was detected. Thus, the immunogenicity of the foreign antigens delivered by measles vaccine virus is dependent on the nature of the insert and the animal models used for vaccine evaluation.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Ebola virus (EBOV) and other members of the family Filoviridae of enveloped, negative-strand RNA viruses are associated with highly lethal disease for which no FDA-approved vaccines or treatments exist. Filovirus particles are characterized by a thread-like morphology, with infectious virions averaging 800 to 1,000 nm in length by 100 nm in diameter (1). The viral genome is encapsidated by several proteins, the nucleoprotein (NP), VP24, VP30, and VP35, to form the ribonucleocapsid, along with the L polymerase (2, 3). The VP40 matrix protein adds structural support through interfaces with the nucleocapsid and the viral envelope (4). Studding the viral membrane are metastable trimeric glycoprotein (GP) spikes composed of disulfide-linked heterodimers, the GP1 receptor-binding subunit, and the GP2 fusion subunit (5).\\nThe filovirus GP2 subunit is categorized as a class I viral fusion protein on the basis of its α-helical major domains or heptad repeat (HR) regions (6). The N-terminal HR of GP2 comprises segments that encircle GP1 along with the internal fusion loop, which packs against an adjacent GP1 monomer (7). For insertion into apposing host membranes, the fusion loop must be extricated from its position in prefusion spikes and presumably extended before GP2 refolds. The postfusion structure of GP2 trimers is marked by six-helix bundle (6HB) formation (8, 9), consistent with other class I viral fusion proteins (10), bringing the host and viral membranes into close proximity to lower the kinetic barriers to fusion. Hemifusion of the outer bilayer leaflets precedes formation of a full fusion pore for the cytoplasmic release of the viral genome.\\nLike other filoviruses, EBOV is capable of binding a variety of surface molecules, which contributes to its broad cellular tropism. C-type lectins and phosphatidylserine receptors have been implicated in attachment, though their roles in uptake have not been fully defined (11–14), and T-cell immunoglobulin domain-1 may act as a receptor on epithelial cells (15). Internalization of EBOV occurs primarily through a macropinocytosis-like process, and the virus traffics through the endocytic pathway (16–18). Proteolytic cleavage of GP1 by a class of low-pH-activated proteases, cysteine cathepsins, removes the C-terminal glycan cap and mucin domain sequences (19) to reveal a receptor-binding domain. This newly exposed GP1 domain interacts with Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), which serves as an obligate intracellular receptor for filoviruses (20, 21). While cathepsin cleavage and subsequent NPC1 binding are indispensable for infection, they are themselves insufficient to mediate release of the viral genome to the cytoplasm (22). A final trigger for fusion of viral and endosomal membranes by GP2 has been postulated but not demonstrated (23, 24), and which precise endosomal compartment actually supports fusion is unknown.\\nTo date, progress in defining the requirements for EBOV fusion triggering has been hampered by the lack of robust assays with true biological relevance. In order to examine GP triggering more fully, we have used a real-time microscopy assay for the detection of GP-mediated lipid mixing within cells. This assay further enables the events of GP triggering and lipid mixing to be uncoupled from full fusion and infection. In this report, we characterize GP-mediated lipid mixing and investigate host factors thought to be involved in the process. Our findings identify essential but distinct roles for cysteine cathepsins and NPC1 in EBOV GP fusion triggering.\\nFor evaluating EBOV GP triggering under biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions, we generated vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotypes, which provide a highly validated surrogate system for recapitulating filovirus entry (25, 26). To facilitate viral tracking in most experiments, virions were engineered to contain a fluorescent protein, monomeric NeonGreen (mNG), fused to the viral phosphoprotein (P) (27, 28). The heavily glycosylated mucin domain (Muc) of EBOV GP is dispensable for entry, and its deletion enhances viral attachment (29, 30). Accordingly, we primarily used VSV pseudotypes bearing mucin domain-deleted GP (GPΔMuc). To validate our viral preparations, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine (DiD)-labeled VSV bearing mNG-P and EBOV GPΔMuc was bound to a coverslip and incubated with Alexa Fluor 555-labeled KZ52, a neutralizing antibody that recognizes a conformational epitope at the GP1-GP2 interface (7). On average, over 90% of DiD-labeled particles also possessed NG-P signal, and 72% of total particles exhibited triple-labeling, indicating that the preparations used were of high quality (Fig. 1A).\\nThe lipophilic dye DiD spontaneously incorporates into membranes and displays fluorescence self-quenching at high concentrations. Lipid mixing between viral and host bilayers, as in hemifusion or fusion, enables lateral diffusion of the dye accompanied by dequenching or increased fluorescence intensity (31, 32). Virions were labeled so that the fluorescence signal of self-quenched DiD was detectable prior to dequenching. DiD dequenching resulted in a sharp increase in signal, which we define here as at least a doubling of DiD intensity within 20 s, and a net increase in intensity of 2- to 5-fold within 1 min was typically observed (Fig. 1B and C; see also Movie S1 in the supplemental material). In our experiments, increases in DiD signal sorted strictly into one of two groups: very fast or very slow. Fast dequenching, as indicated by a representative trace (Fig. 1D, solid line), occurred irrespective of nucleocapsid release (data not shown) and appears to indicate specifically triggered lipid mixing events. We attribute the significantly lower rate of DiD dequenching (Fig. 1D, dotted line) to nonspecific transfer of the dye to host membranes, possibly through particle degradation. Only fast events constituted “dequenching” in this study. We found that the extent of dequenching varied somewhat among DiD-labeled particles. This may reflect differences in the volumes of endocytic compartments, as well as in the concentration of dye within the viral membrane, as some heterogeneity in self-quenching was noted. Dequenching events occurring at later postinfection time points generally exhibited greater amplitude between the quenched and dequenched states (data not shown).\\nWe initially investigated dequenching kinetics in Vero cells, due to their high permissivity and established use in filovirus infection studies. The time span needed for 50% of particles bearing EBOV GPΔMuc to dequench (t1/2) was 42 min, considerably greater than the t1/2 of 17 min for similar particles bearing VSV G, which is believed to undergo fusion triggering in early endosomes (Fig. 2A) (33, 34). We found that the dequenching kinetics for VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc particles were very similar in U2OS cells (t1/2 = 44 min, Fig. 2B), and, because autofluorescence is much lower than in Vero cells, we used U2OS cells in the bulk of our experiments. Regardless of cell type, virtually all dequenching events occurred within 2 h of the synchronized onset of infection. We also examined the dequenching kinetics of VSV particles bearing full-length EBOV GP. Although the onset and conclusion of dequenching events showed similar timings, the overall rate of dequenching by VSV-EBOV GP (t1/2 = 64 min) was slower than that of VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc, which may reflect differences in internalization or the need for additional proteolytic processing (Fig. 2C). Precleavage of EBOV GPΔMuc by thermolysin, which structurally and functionally mimics the required cleavage of EBOV GP by endosomal/lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin B (19, 35), did not accelerate dequenching kinetics compared to uncleaved EBOV GPΔMuc.\\nLive imaging revealed that the majority of virions did not engage in lipid mixing (Fig. 2D). Of the total number of cell-associated VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc particles, approximately 16% dequenched in Vero cells and 10% in U2OS cells within 2 h. Additionally, 9.1% of particles bearing full-length EBOV GP dequenched in U2OS cells in the same time span. VSV G particles showed similarly low probabilities for lipid mixing in the two cell types. Although we are unable to distinguish definitively between bound and internalized virions, nearly all cell-associated particles had trafficked to perinuclear regions by the end of experiments (data not shown), leading us to believe that uptake levels are high with both EBOV GP and VSV G. The low percentage of particles with actual relevance to infection validates our single-particle approach to elucidating aspects of EBOV entry.\\nIn order to confirm that the observed dequenching events indeed represented GP-mediated lipid mixing, we first assessed dequenching in the presence of NH4Cl. Failure to acidify endosomes precludes GP activation and infection (36, 37), as low pH is required for cysteine cathepsin activity (38) and possibly for fusogenic conformational changes in GP (39, 40). We found nearly a complete reduction of VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc dequenching by NH4Cl treatment, which lends support to the observed lipid mixing being specifically GP mediated (Fig. 3A).\\nThe need for host cysteine cathepsin cleavage of EBOV GP in infection is well established (19, 35). Pan-cysteine cathepsin inhibitors, such as E-64d, prevent entry by filoviruses, which differ in their preference for cleavage by cathepsin B or L (19, 41). We found that E-64d treatment reduced EBOV GPΔMuc-mediated lipid mixing by more than 90%, while lipid mixing by VSV G-bearing particles was not similarly affected (Fig. 3B), demonstrating that a lack of cysteine cathepsin activity hinders downstream events in lipid mixing for EBOV GP.\\nAs neutralizing antibodies directed against the EBOV GP base, such as KZ52 (7, 42) or c4G7 and c2G4 in the ZMapp antibody cocktail (43–45), have been hypothesized to inhibit fusogenic structural rearrangement, we evaluated their effects on lipid mixing (Fig. 3C). Our results confirm that KZ52 and ZMapp treatments specifically render EBOV GP less able to engage in lipid mixing while leaving viral internalization and trafficking unaltered (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material). Preincubation of VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc with KZ52 resulted in inhibition of dequenching by 60% at 50 µg/ml and 85% at 100 µg/ml. ZMapp also had a concentration-dependent, if slightly more potent, effect on dequenching, with lipid mixing inhibited by 83% at 50 µg/ml and 91% at 100 µg/ml. Neither antibody treatment was able to abolish dequenching, even though the concentrations used were approximately 30-fold to 40-fold higher than the reported IC90 values for viral neutralization by KZ52, c2G4, and c4G7 individually (42, 45). This supports the idea of the existence of a significant barrier to fusion, with the number of unencumbered GP molecules needed for simple lipid mixing being much lower than the number needed to bring about membrane fusion and genome release. Collectively, our results signify that lipid mixing is the express product of GP triggering, which entails some degree of conformational change by proteolytically primed EBOV GP and which may lead to or encompass full fusion.\\nThe endosomal/lysosomal membrane protein NPC1, involved in cholesterol homeostasis, serves as an essential intracellular receptor for filovirus infection, with a cysteine cathepsin-cleaved form of GP directly recognizing the lumenal domain C of NPC1 (20–22, 46). Because the precise role of NPC1 in filovirus entry has not been fully defined, we evaluated lipid mixing in the absence of NPC1 (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). Dequenching of VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc particles was inhibited almost entirely in NPC1-deficient U2OS cells, whereas VSV G dequenching was unaffected, indicating that NPC1 expression is vital for EBOV fusion triggering (Fig. 4A).\\nMutations at the putative GP1-NPC1 interface have been previously demonstrated to reduce GP1-NPC1 interaction and greatly impair infectivity (22, 47, 48). Recent work has shown that proteolytic cleavage of GP1 exposes the NPC1-binding site, comprising a basic/polar crest overhanging a deep hydrophobic trough (65). We investigated entry by VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc particles bearing three mutations in the NPC1-binding site (T83M in the trough, K114E/K115E in the crest) that abolish GP1-NPC1 interaction and viral infectivity (65). Lipid mixing was reduced by 97% with this triple mutant (Fig. 4B). The inhibition of lipid mixing by VSV-EBOV GP in NPC1-deficient U2OS cells and by VSV-EBOV GP (T83M/K114E/K115E) in wild-type (wt) U2OS cells was not explained by altered delivery to endosomal/lysosomal compartments, since postinfection colocalization of viral particles and endocytic markers was not significantly reduced (see Fig. S1B in the supplemental material).\\nNPC1’s functionality as a cholesterol transporter may also have some bearing on EBOV entry, as GP-mediated lipid mixing is selectively inhibited by the cationic amphiphile U18666A (Fig. 4C), which induces an NPC1 disease phenotype marked by cholesterol accumulation within late endosomes and lysosomes (20, 49). GP1-NPC1 binding is not affected by U18666A (20, 24), but short-term U18666A treatments that do not cause substantial cholesterol accumulation (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material) nevertheless prevent EBOV entry (20), suggesting that this block is due to the drug’s specific effect on NPC1 rather than to the resulting increase in endosomal/lysosomal cholesterol levels. Taken together, our results provide direct evidence that NPC1 facilitates one or more early steps in EBOV membrane fusion.\\nColocalization of dequenching virions with fluorescently labeled endosomal markers was performed in order to elucidate the compartment in which EBOV GP-dependent membrane fusion is triggered (Fig. 5; see also Movies S2 to S5 in the supplemental material). Although a recent report suggested that EBOV fuses exclusively in compartments devoid of NPC1 (50), we found that all dequenching particles in NPC1-mNG-expressing cells colocalized with this marker at the time of dequenching (Fig. 5J; see also Movie S5). Additionally, the high percentage of dequenching particles colocalized with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Rab7 (98%) indicates the ubiquity of this protein in endosomes supporting GP triggering. Further evidence that EBOV must traffic to a suitably mature compartment for fusion was provided by inhibition of dequenching by the two-pore calcium channel (TPC)-blocking small molecule tetrandrine (Fig. 6). Tetrandrine, which may impair the activity of TPC in endocytic trafficking and heterotypic fusion of vesicles (51), was recently shown to inhibit EBOV infection in vitro and in vivo (50) and decreased GP-mediated lipid mixing in our assay by 95% at 10 µM.\\nWhile considerable lipid mixing also occurred in GFP-LAMP1+ vesicles (75%), we found, surprisingly, that a significant fraction of dequenching VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc particles (15%) colocalized with GFP-Rab5 puncta. Despite their slower rate of lipid mixing events (Fig. 2C), 10% of particles bearing full-length EBOV GP also dequenched in Rab5+ compartments (data not shown). Because Rab7 appears to be a nearly essential component of the EBOV fusion compartment, these Rab5+ vesicles are likely intermediate endosomes, suggesting that GP triggering can occur earlier in the endocytic pathway than commonly believed (20, 50, 52, 53). Our results also imply that some population of endosomes must display Rab5 and NPC1 concurrently, at least in the U2OS cell line used. We detected an average lag of 6 min (ranging from 40 s to more than 20 min) between colocalization of viral and NPC1 signals and dequenching, indicating that the occurrence of GP triggering is not immediate upon delivery to NPC1+ compartments (Fig. 5K).\\nTo examine the effect of fusion loop mutation on lipid mixing, we tested two previously published GP2 mutants (Fig. 7) (54, 55). Internalization and late endosomal delivery of VSV particles bearing these mutants did not differ significantly from VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc (see Fig. S1C in the supplemental material), indicating that their defects are specific to aspects of fusion. The GP (F535R) mutant, characterized as having impaired membrane binding and insertion capability (54), exhibited no defect in lipid mixing while being unable to support infection. Another fusion loop mutant, GP (L529A/I544A) (54), showed substantially decreased lipid mixing. The L529A/I544A mutation is believed to prevent formation of the hydrophobic fusion loop tip at low pH, with L529 and I544 creating a scaffold along with F535 (54, 55). While nonviable, the double mutant did effect low-level lipid mixing (Fig. 7), suggesting that even severely disrupted GP fusion loops retain some capacity for membrane insertion in cells.\\nIn order to separate possible requirements for cysteine cathepsins pre- and post-NPC1 binding, we evaluated lipid mixing by GP in various cleavage states in the presence and absence of E-64d. Thermolysin was used to generate particles either fully or partially lacking C-terminal GP1 sequences corresponding to the glycan cap and mucin domains (Fig. 8A). While increased infectivity of particles bearing cleaved GP has been reported (19, 30, 35), we did not observe this phenomenon or enhanced lipid mixing. When particles were bound to cells to the same extent, cleaved and uncleaved GP produced similar levels of lipid mixing and infection (Fig. 8B and C). Unexpectedly, we found that dequenching by particles with cleaved EBOV GP was much less susceptible to E-64d blockage and that the degree of lipid mixing correlated with the extent of GP cleavage (Fig. 8C). Fully cleaved GP exhibited slight hyperfusogenicity that was unaffected in the absence of cathepsin activity. The inability of precleavage to rescue infectivity in E-64d-treated cells (Fig. 8B), however, indicates that a specific requirement for cathepsins in fusion pore formation lies post-NPC1 binding.\\nMost previous attempts to characterize EBOV membrane fusion have relied on assessing delivery of viral content, such as luciferase or β-lactamase, through which GP triggering is inferred (24, 52, 56). While content delivery assays are useful in characterizing infection on a general scale, they have sizable limitations. For example, they cannot resolve the fates of individual particles or differentiate between hemifusion, incomplete fusion pore expansion, and no GP triggering at all. In order to examine GP fusion triggering directly, we have employed an assay for tracking real-time lipid mixing by single particles that revealed novel and significant aspects of the process.\\nWe found, unsurprisingly, that the majority of cell-associated particles did not advance to lipid mixing (Fig. 2D). The low probability of lipid mixing suggests that the results of previously published experiments utilizing bulk endocytosis may be misleading, with an inadvertent focus on nontriggered virions. This presents a particular obstacle in determining factors involved in EBOV GP fusion triggering or the compartment(s) in which triggering occurs.\\nThe interaction between cysteine cathepsin-primed GP1 and NPC1 has been previously shown to be vital for filovirus infection (22); however, the precise role of NPC1 in this process was unknown. Here, we used an NPC1-deficient cell line and a GP mutant unable to bind NPC1 to prove that the GP-NPC1 interaction, and not just virus-NPC1 colocalization, is indispensable for EBOV fusion triggering and lipid mixing (Fig. 3 and 4). We found that the appearance of NPC1 in virus-bearing endosomes always preceded GP triggering, though the time span between the two events varied (Fig. 5K), as also reported by Simmons and colleagues through a live-cell imaging assay with GP-pseudotyped retroviruses while the current article was in preparation (53). Mingo et al. proposed that delivery to NPC1+ vesicles represented a key rate-limiting step for EBOV fusion (52), but we found a lag ranging from 40 s to more than 20 min between virus-NPC1 colocalization and dequenching. It is unknown at present whether NPC1 binding directly promotes fusogenic conformational changes in GP or primes it for interaction with additional host factors. Therefore, while the lag may represent the span of time needed for the virus to bind NPC1 as its lumenal domains appear in the compartment, it may also signify a need for one or more host factors to act on GP prior to or following GP1-NPC1 interaction.\\nWe provide direct evidence that EBOV GP fusion triggering occurs in NPC1+/Rab7+ vesicles, which may, in fact, encompass a range of endosomal compartments. Previously thought to undergo triggering only quite late in the endocytic pathway (50, 53), EBOV GP could mediate lipid mixing in intermediate endosomes, as indicated by their Rab5 signal, in our live assays. Because the presence of NPC1 is an absolute requirement for dequenching in our assay, we infer that some population of Rab5+ vesicles must contain NPC1 in U2OS cells. Such colocalization is not impossible, as immunofluorescence and fractionation studies have shown that NPC1 localizes primarily, but not entirely, to late endosomes, lysosomes, and the trans-Golgi network (49); therefore, NPC1 levels in some intermediate endosomes may be sufficient to support GP triggering. However, it is unclear whether viral genome release from relatively immature endosomes can occur following GP fusion triggering. Indeed, Simmons et al. found no evidence for GP-mediated retroviral content release from Rab5+ compartments (53), raising the possibility that virions must traffic further in the endocytic pathway to encounter host factors at levels necessary for complete fusion and genome release.\\nPrevious work has revealed that a conformational epitope at the GP1-GP2 interface in the GP base is targeted by multiple neutralizing antibodies, including two of three components of the ZMapp therapeutic cocktail (7, 44, 45), leading to the hypothesis that this epitope is an “Achilles heel” for filoviruses. It was proposed on structural grounds that these base-binding antibodies potently neutralize by blocking fusogenic rearrangement and membrane insertion by GP2. Here, we provide the first direct evidence that neutralizing antibodies targeting the EBOV GP base inhibit viral fusion triggering (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, higher concentrations of neutralizing antibody were required to inhibit lipid mixing to the same extent as infection, but this may typify fusion by enveloped viruses. A recent study by Otterstrom et al. (57) examined the levels of antibody binding needed to inhibit influenza virus hemifusion. Using a pair of potent, broadly effective neutralizing antibodies, whose inhibitory profiles against influenza virus strains are very similar to those of KZ52 and ZMapp against filoviruses (58, 59), the authors showed that only high concentrations of these stem-binding antibodies were able to block the majority of hemifusion events. Although their assay (viral particles bound to a supported bilayer) differed from ours, their data strongly corroborate our results, with approximately 50 to 150 µg/ml of either anti-influenza virus antibody needed to reduce in vitro hemifusion by ~90%. The requirement for antibody concentrations beyond relevance to infection indicates a far lower threshold for lipid mixing than for full fusion and content release.\\nFurther highlighting the distinction between EBOV lipid mixing and fusion, we found that GP mutations that abrogated infectivity did not necessarily extend to lipid mixing (Fig. 7). Although the F535R mutation was shown to reduce the binding of GP2 ectodomains with liposomes (54), we noted that lipid mixing in live cells was unaffected. Additionally, a peptide corresponding to the fusion loop of the L529A/I544A GP mutant was unable to insert into model membranes or promote lipid mixing in a cell-free system (38). While we likewise found that the L529A/I544A double mutant could not support infection, lipid mixing activity within cells was significantly reduced but not completely inhibited, indicating that the amino acid sequence may behave differently in native GP and in an isolated peptide, much less in an in vitro system. Shallow insertion of the fusion loop may be sufficient to yield lipid mixing in cells, even while failing to interact with the target membrane extensively enough for progression to full fusion pore formation.\\nEntry by virions bearing precleaved EBOV GP remains sensitive to inhibitors of host cysteine cathepsin activity, suggesting the existence of an additional protease-dependent step in filovirus membrane fusion (19, 35, 60). Surprisingly, however, our experiments revealed that lipid mixing by cleaved GP was entirely unaffected by inhibition of host cysteine cathepsin activity, even as infectivity was ablated (as reported previously) (Fig. 8). The latter finding is in agreement with that of Simmons et al., who found no evidence of content release by retroviral particles bearing cleaved GP in E-64d-treated cells; however, they were unable to examine lipid mixing consistently in their assay (53).\\nOur findings suggest that, following GP-NPC1 binding, cysteine cathepsins are dispensable for GP fusion triggering and lipid mixing but play a critical role in the formation and/or expansion of fusion pores that allow cytoplasmic release of viral genomes. We advance two mechanistic scenarios to account for our observations. First, the fusion trigger (comprising NPC1 and possibly an additional signal, e.g., acid pH, but not cysteine cathepsins) releases GP from its prefusion conformation, allowing formation of a membrane-bound prehairpin intermediate and driving hemifusion of viral and cellular membranes. A final cysteine cathepsin cleavage event then enables GP refolding to a 6HB, which mediates fusion pore formation and genome release. A similar two-step mechanism, with sequential roles for receptor binding and low pH, has been proposed for fusion by the avian sarcoma/leukosis retrovirus (61). Alternatively, it is conceivable that proteolytic cleavage of NPC1-bound GP is indeed the fusion trigger but that GP fusion triggering and 6HB formation can nevertheless occur inefficiently in the absence of cysteine cathepsin activity. Rearrangement of a few GP trimers may permit lipid mixing but not energetically costly fusion pore formation and expansion.\\nWhile this initial study focused primarily on the GP triggering and lipid mixing steps of EBOV entry, further work is needed to elucidate outstanding issues, such as the precise mechanism that explains why post-NPC1-binding cathepsin activity is required for infection but not lipid mixing. Future live-cell studies will examine the dynamics of fusion pore expansion and viral genome release and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the EBOV entry process.\\nU2OS human osteosarcoma cells were cultured in McCoy’s 5a medium (Gibco), and Vero grivet monkey kidney cells and human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (Gibco). All culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin.\\nGeneration of U2OS NPC1-ko cells was carried out by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing (62) using previously described methods (26). Briefly, a CRISPR guide RNA (gRNA) cloning vector (Addgene plasmid 41824) encoding an NPC1-specific gRNA that targets nucleotides 768 to 790 (5′ GGCCTTGTCATTACTTGAGGGGG 3′ on the complementary strand) of human NPC1 mRNA was cotransfected along with a plasmid encoding human-codon-optimized endonuclease Cas9 (Addgene plasmid 41815), a red fluorescent protein expression plasmid (to monitor transfection efficiency), and pMX-IRES-Bla (conferring blasticidin resistance to transfected cells). Following selection of transfected cells by blasticidin treatment, genomic DNA flanking the gRNA target site was amplified by PCR using forward (5′ TCATAAACACACCAAACTTGGAATC 3′) and reverse (5′ TCCTGCGGCAGAGGTTTTC 3′) primers and tested for indels by Surveyor assay as previously described (26). Once genome editing was confirmed at the population level, multiple single-cell clones were isolated for NPC1 gene sequencing. A clonal cell line, NPC1-#6, was found to contain a deletion of 13 nucleotides in both of its NPC1 alleles. The deletion in NPC1-#6 cells is predicted to cause a frame shift at amino acid position 167 that leads to production of a truncated protein of 215 amino acids, in comparison to the 1,278 amino acids of wild-type NPC1. We confirmed the absence of any remaining wild-type NPC1 alleles by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using NPC1-F (5′ AGGCCCCCTCAAGTAATGAC 3′, specific for the deleted sequence in the NPC1-knockout cell line) and npc1-R (5′ GCCCAAAGTGCTGGTCAAAG 3′) primers. Amplification of the site-1 protease (S1P) gene using S1P-F (5′ GATGTGCTCTGGCAGATGGG 3′) and S1P-R (5′ TTTCACGCCAGAACCCCGC 3′) primers was used as a positive control for RT-PCR.\\nPseudotyped virions were generated by infecting 293T cells expressing viral glycoproteins with VSV lacking its G gene, as previously described (19, 26, 28). GP cDNA derived from EBOV/H.sap/COD/76/Yam-Mayinga (EBOV “Mayinga” isolate) was used to generate VSV-EBOV GP. EBOV GPΔMuc lacks GP residues 309 to 489 (29). All EBOV GP mutants were generated in the GPΔMuc background. Infection supernatants were collected upon observation of significant cytopathy (1 to 4 days postinfection). Clarified supernatants were centrifuged at 4°C and 70,000 × g using an SW28 rotor to pellet the virus. Viral pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and further purified through a 10% sucrose cushion at 4°C and 107,000 × g using an SW41 rotor. Pellets were then resuspended in PBS at an approximate viral protein concentration of 1 mg/ml, and aliquots were stored at −80°C until use. Viral infectivity was assessed as previously described (19).\\nCleavage of EBOV-GP was performed by incubating the virus with 250 µg/ml thermolysin (Sigma) for 1 h for partially cleaved GP and 500 µg/ml thermolysin for 2 h for fully cleaved GP at 37°C after the first ultracentrifugation step. Protease activity was quenched by addition of 1 mM phosphoramidon (Peptides International) and incubation on ice for 20 min prior to the second ultracentrifugation step through a sucrose cushion. The extent of cleavage was confirmed by immunoblotting with an anti-GP1 antibody.\\nViral membranes were labeled with self-quenching concentrations of DiD (Life Technologies). Virus (50 µg) was incubated with 250 µM DiD for 90 min with gentle agitation in the dark at room temperature. Labeled virus was passed through a NAP-5 column (GE Healthcare) to remove excess dye and large aggregates and was used for imaging within 48 h. DiD labeling reduced viral infectivity by less than 10% (data not shown).\\nZMapp was a gift from John Dye (USAMRIID). For production of KZ52, various heavy- and light-chain domains of KZ52 were chemically synthesized as codon-optimized sequences for expression in human cells by Epoch Life Sciences and cloned into pMAZ-IgH (containing the expression cassette of human γ1 chain constant domains) and pMAZ-IgL (containing the expression cassette of human κ light-chain constant domains) vectors (63), respectively, using a Gibson assembly kit (New England Biolabs). Sanger sequencing confirmed the identity of the cloned vectors. Antibody production and purification were carried out as described earlier (64), with modifications. Briefly, suspension-adapted HEK293-Freestyle cells–grown in suspension cultures in Freestyle F17 expression media (Thermo Scientific)–were cotransfected with pMAZ-IgH-KZ52 and pMAZ-IgL-KZ52 (1:1 ratio) vectors using polyethyleneimine. At 6 to 7 days posttransfection, the supernatant was collected and incubated overnight at 4°C with protein A agarose resin (GenScript Corporation) in the presence of cOmplete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Life Sciences). After the resin was washed with PBS (pH 8.0), bound IgG was eluted with 100 mM glycine (pH 3.0) into 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The eluate was concentrated and buffer exchanged with PBS by use of an Amicon centrifugal filter concentrator (Millipore) with a molecular weight cutoff of 30,000 Da. Purified antibody was stored at −20°C. Protein concentration and yield were determined by UV absorbance, and purity was determined by SDS-PAGE. For labeling coverslip-bound virus, KZ52 was conjugated with Zenon Alexa Fluor 555 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\\nStock solutions of drugs were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or water and stored as frozen aliquots until use. Cells were incubated with ammonium chloride (Sigma) for 15 min or with E-64d (Peptides International) and tetrandrine (Sigma) for 1 h prior to experiments performed at the indicated concentrations. No preincubation with U18666A (Calbiochem) was performed. Inhibitors were maintained at the same concentrations during spinoculation and imaging.\\nFor expression of fluorescently labeled endocytic pathway markers, cells were transduced with CellLight vectors (Life Technologies) for early endosomes (GFP-Rab5), late endosomes (GFP-Rab7), or lysosomes (GFP-LAMP1) 18 h prior to imaging according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A retroviral packaging vector bearing NPC1-mNG was also generated, and cells were transduced 18 h in advance of imaging.\\nLive imaging was performed on a DeltaVision widefield epifluorescence microscope (GE Healthcare) at 37°C. The microscope was equipped with a heated environmental chamber, an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) camera (Photometrics), a 40×/1.35 numerical-aperture (NA) oil immersion objective, and a DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)/fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/tetramethyl rhodamine isocyanate (TRITC)/Cy5 filter set.\\nCells were seeded on fibronectin-coated 35-mm-diameter coverslip dishes (MatTek) 24 h in advance of experiments and were grown to approximately 70% confluence. Dishes were placed on ice for several minutes before addition of virus. Virus in imaging buffer (140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose, 2 µg/ml Hoechst stain, and 2% FBS, pH 7.4) was spinoculated onto cells by 20 min of centrifugation at 1,500 × g at 4°C. Inoculum volumes were adjusted so that 200 to 400 cell-associated particles were visible per field. Unbound particles were removed by four washes with cold PBS, and 500 µl cold imaging buffer was added to the dish. Samples were mounted on the microscope and quickly focused, and then 1.5 ml warm imaging buffer was added to start the experiment (t = 0). Images were acquired every 4 s over the duration of the experiments using a single Z-section, as the cells were very flat. Excluding the initial kinetics studies, all experiments were limited to 2 h.\\nImage analysis and single-particle tracking were performed using Volocity software (PerkinElmer). Excluding minor adjustments in brightness and contrast, image files were not manipulated. For single-particle dequenching measurements, puncta were thresholded by initial intensity and size. Puncta falling outside the range of 0.125 to 1.0 µm2 expected of discrete VSV particles were excluded from analysis.\\nFor colocalization of dequenching particles with cellular markers, a virion was considered colocalized only if the GFP or mNG punctum exceeded the cellular background signal by 30% or more and if the GFP or mNG and DiD puncta cotrafficked (greater than 80% overlap of DiD signal with GFP or mNG signal) for at least 20 s before and after a dequenching event. The majority of colocalized dequenching events far exceeded these criteria.\\nMean measurements (± standard deviations [SD]) were derived from three separate experiments, unless otherwise indicated. Statistical significance was established by Student’s t test or by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a post hoc Dunnett’s test (**, P &lt; 0.01; ***, P &lt; 0.001; ****, P &lt; 0.0001).</td>\n",

              "      <td>For evaluating EBOV GP triggering under biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions, we generated vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotypes, which provide a highly validated surrogate system for recapitulating filovirus entry (25, 26). To facilitate viral tracking in most experiments, virions were engineered to contain a fluorescent protein, monomeric NeonGreen (mNG), fused to the viral phosphoprotein (P) (27, 28). The heavily glycosylated mucin domain (Muc) of EBOV GP is dispensable for entry, and its deletion enhances viral attachment (29, 30). Accordingly, we primarily used VSV pseudotypes bearing mucin domain-deleted GP (GPΔMuc). To validate our viral preparations, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine (DiD)-labeled VSV bearing mNG-P and EBOV GPΔMuc was bound to a coverslip and incubated with Alexa Fluor 555-labeled KZ52, a neutralizing antibody that recognizes a conformational epitope at the GP1-GP2 interface (7). On average, over 90% of DiD-labeled particles also possessed NG-P signal, and 72% of total particles exhibited triple-labeling, indicating that the preparations used were of high quality (Fig. 1A).\\nThe lipophilic dye DiD spontaneously incorporates into membranes and displays fluorescence self-quenching at high concentrations. Lipid mixing between viral and host bilayers, as in hemifusion or fusion, enables lateral diffusion of the dye accompanied by dequenching or increased fluorescence intensity (31, 32). Virions were labeled so that the fluorescence signal of self-quenched DiD was detectable prior to dequenching. DiD dequenching resulted in a sharp increase in signal, which we define here as at least a doubling of DiD intensity within 20 s, and a net increase in intensity of 2- to 5-fold within 1 min was typically observed (Fig. 1B and C; see also Movie S1 in the supplemental material). In our experiments, increases in DiD signal sorted strictly into one of two groups: very fast or very slow. Fast dequenching, as indicated by a representative trace (Fig. 1D, solid line), occurred irrespective of nucleocapsid release (data not shown) and appears to indicate specifically triggered lipid mixing events. We attribute the significantly lower rate of DiD dequenching (Fig. 1D, dotted line) to nonspecific transfer of the dye to host membranes, possibly through particle degradation. Only fast events constituted “dequenching” in this study. We found that the extent of dequenching varied somewhat among DiD-labeled particles. This may reflect differences in the volumes of endocytic compartments, as well as in the concentration of dye within the viral membrane, as some heterogeneity in self-quenching was noted. Dequenching events occurring at later postinfection time points generally exhibited greater amplitude between the quenched and dequenched states (data not shown).\\nWe initially investigated dequenching kinetics in Vero cells, due to their high permissivity and established use in filovirus infection studies. The time span needed for 50% of particles bearing EBOV GPΔMuc to dequench (t1/2) was 42 min, considerably greater than the t1/2 of 17 min for similar particles bearing VSV G, which is believed to undergo fusion triggering in early endosomes (Fig. 2A) (33, 34). We found that the dequenching kinetics for VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc particles were very similar in U2OS cells (t1/2 = 44 min, Fig. 2B), and, because autofluorescence is much lower than in Vero cells, we used U2OS cells in the bulk of our experiments. Regardless of cell type, virtually all dequenching events occurred within 2 h of the synchronized onset of infection. We also examined the dequenching kinetics of VSV particles bearing full-length EBOV GP. Although the onset and conclusion of dequenching events showed similar timings, the overall rate of dequenching by VSV-EBOV GP (t1/2 = 64 min) was slower than that of VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc, which may reflect differences in internalization or the need for additional proteolytic processing (Fig. 2C). Precleavage of EBOV GPΔMuc by thermolysin, which structurally and functionally mimics the required cleavage of EBOV GP by endosomal/lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin B (19, 35), did not accelerate dequenching kinetics compared to uncleaved EBOV GPΔMuc.\\nLive imaging revealed that the majority of virions did not engage in lipid mixing (Fig. 2D). Of the total number of cell-associated VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc particles, approximately 16% dequenched in Vero cells and 10% in U2OS cells within 2 h. Additionally, 9.1% of particles bearing full-length EBOV GP dequenched in U2OS cells in the same time span. VSV G particles showed similarly low probabilities for lipid mixing in the two cell types. Although we are unable to distinguish definitively between bound and internalized virions, nearly all cell-associated particles had trafficked to perinuclear regions by the end of experiments (data not shown), leading us to believe that uptake levels are high with both EBOV GP and VSV G. The low percentage of particles with actual relevance to infection validates our single-particle approach to elucidating aspects of EBOV entry.\\nIn order to confirm that the observed dequenching events indeed represented GP-mediated lipid mixing, we first assessed dequenching in the presence of NH4Cl. Failure to acidify endosomes precludes GP activation and infection (36, 37), as low pH is required for cysteine cathepsin activity (38) and possibly for fusogenic conformational changes in GP (39, 40). We found nearly a complete reduction of VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc dequenching by NH4Cl treatment, which lends support to the observed lipid mixing being specifically GP mediated (Fig. 3A).\\nThe need for host cysteine cathepsin cleavage of EBOV GP in infection is well established (19, 35). Pan-cysteine cathepsin inhibitors, such as E-64d, prevent entry by filoviruses, which differ in their preference for cleavage by cathepsin B or L (19, 41). We found that E-64d treatment reduced EBOV GPΔMuc-mediated lipid mixing by more than 90%, while lipid mixing by VSV G-bearing particles was not similarly affected (Fig. 3B), demonstrating that a lack of cysteine cathepsin activity hinders downstream events in lipid mixing for EBOV GP.\\nAs neutralizing antibodies directed against the EBOV GP base, such as KZ52 (7, 42) or c4G7 and c2G4 in the ZMapp antibody cocktail (43–45), have been hypothesized to inhibit fusogenic structural rearrangement, we evaluated their effects on lipid mixing (Fig. 3C). Our results confirm that KZ52 and ZMapp treatments specifically render EBOV GP less able to engage in lipid mixing while leaving viral internalization and trafficking unaltered (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material). Preincubation of VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc with KZ52 resulted in inhibition of dequenching by 60% at 50 µg/ml and 85% at 100 µg/ml. ZMapp also had a concentration-dependent, if slightly more potent, effect on dequenching, with lipid mixing inhibited by 83% at 50 µg/ml and 91% at 100 µg/ml. Neither antibody treatment was able to abolish dequenching, even though the concentrations used were approximately 30-fold to 40-fold higher than the reported IC90 values for viral neutralization by KZ52, c2G4, and c4G7 individually (42, 45). This supports the idea of the existence of a significant barrier to fusion, with the number of unencumbered GP molecules needed for simple lipid mixing being much lower than the number needed to bring about membrane fusion and genome release. Collectively, our results signify that lipid mixing is the express product of GP triggering, which entails some degree of conformational change by proteolytically primed EBOV GP and which may lead to or encompass full fusion.\\nThe endosomal/lysosomal membrane protein NPC1, involved in cholesterol homeostasis, serves as an essential intracellular receptor for filovirus infection, with a cysteine cathepsin-cleaved form of GP directly recognizing the lumenal domain C of NPC1 (20–22, 46). Because the precise role of NPC1 in filovirus entry has not been fully defined, we evaluated lipid mixing in the absence of NPC1 (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). Dequenching of VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc particles was inhibited almost entirely in NPC1-deficient U2OS cells, whereas VSV G dequenching was unaffected, indicating that NPC1 expression is vital for EBOV fusion triggering (Fig. 4A).\\nMutations at the putative GP1-NPC1 interface have been previously demonstrated to reduce GP1-NPC1 interaction and greatly impair infectivity (22, 47, 48). Recent work has shown that proteolytic cleavage of GP1 exposes the NPC1-binding site, comprising a basic/polar crest overhanging a deep hydrophobic trough (65). We investigated entry by VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc particles bearing three mutations in the NPC1-binding site (T83M in the trough, K114E/K115E in the crest) that abolish GP1-NPC1 interaction and viral infectivity (65). Lipid mixing was reduced by 97% with this triple mutant (Fig. 4B). The inhibition of lipid mixing by VSV-EBOV GP in NPC1-deficient U2OS cells and by VSV-EBOV GP (T83M/K114E/K115E) in wild-type (wt) U2OS cells was not explained by altered delivery to endosomal/lysosomal compartments, since postinfection colocalization of viral particles and endocytic markers was not significantly reduced (see Fig. S1B in the supplemental material).\\nNPC1’s functionality as a cholesterol transporter may also have some bearing on EBOV entry, as GP-mediated lipid mixing is selectively inhibited by the cationic amphiphile U18666A (Fig. 4C), which induces an NPC1 disease phenotype marked by cholesterol accumulation within late endosomes and lysosomes (20, 49). GP1-NPC1 binding is not affected by U18666A (20, 24), but short-term U18666A treatments that do not cause substantial cholesterol accumulation (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material) nevertheless prevent EBOV entry (20), suggesting that this block is due to the drug’s specific effect on NPC1 rather than to the resulting increase in endosomal/lysosomal cholesterol levels. Taken together, our results provide direct evidence that NPC1 facilitates one or more early steps in EBOV membrane fusion.\\nColocalization of dequenching virions with fluorescently labeled endosomal markers was performed in order to elucidate the compartment in which EBOV GP-dependent membrane fusion is triggered (Fig. 5; see also Movies S2 to S5 in the supplemental material). Although a recent report suggested that EBOV fuses exclusively in compartments devoid of NPC1 (50), we found that all dequenching particles in NPC1-mNG-expressing cells colocalized with this marker at the time of dequenching (Fig. 5J; see also Movie S5). Additionally, the high percentage of dequenching particles colocalized with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Rab7 (98%) indicates the ubiquity of this protein in endosomes supporting GP triggering. Further evidence that EBOV must traffic to a suitably mature compartment for fusion was provided by inhibition of dequenching by the two-pore calcium channel (TPC)-blocking small molecule tetrandrine (Fig. 6). Tetrandrine, which may impair the activity of TPC in endocytic trafficking and heterotypic fusion of vesicles (51), was recently shown to inhibit EBOV infection in vitro and in vivo (50) and decreased GP-mediated lipid mixing in our assay by 95% at 10 µM.\\nWhile considerable lipid mixing also occurred in GFP-LAMP1+ vesicles (75%), we found, surprisingly, that a significant fraction of dequenching VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc particles (15%) colocalized with GFP-Rab5 puncta. Despite their slower rate of lipid mixing events (Fig. 2C), 10% of particles bearing full-length EBOV GP also dequenched in Rab5+ compartments (data not shown). Because Rab7 appears to be a nearly essential component of the EBOV fusion compartment, these Rab5+ vesicles are likely intermediate endosomes, suggesting that GP triggering can occur earlier in the endocytic pathway than commonly believed (20, 50, 52, 53). Our results also imply that some population of endosomes must display Rab5 and NPC1 concurrently, at least in the U2OS cell line used. We detected an average lag of 6 min (ranging from 40 s to more than 20 min) between colocalization of viral and NPC1 signals and dequenching, indicating that the occurrence of GP triggering is not immediate upon delivery to NPC1+ compartments (Fig. 5K).\\nTo examine the effect of fusion loop mutation on lipid mixing, we tested two previously published GP2 mutants (Fig. 7) (54, 55). Internalization and late endosomal delivery of VSV particles bearing these mutants did not differ significantly from VSV-EBOV GPΔMuc (see Fig. S1C in the supplemental material), indicating that their defects are specific to aspects of fusion. The GP (F535R) mutant, characterized as having impaired membrane binding and insertion capability (54), exhibited no defect in lipid mixing while being unable to support infection. Another fusion loop mutant, GP (L529A/I544A) (54), showed substantially decreased lipid mixing. The L529A/I544A mutation is believed to prevent formation of the hydrophobic fusion loop tip at low pH, with L529 and I544 creating a scaffold along with F535 (54, 55). While nonviable, the double mutant did effect low-level lipid mixing (Fig. 7), suggesting that even severely disrupted GP fusion loops retain some capacity for membrane insertion in cells.\\nIn order to separate possible requirements for cysteine cathepsins pre- and post-NPC1 binding, we evaluated lipid mixing by GP in various cleavage states in the presence and absence of E-64d. Thermolysin was used to generate particles either fully or partially lacking C-terminal GP1 sequences corresponding to the glycan cap and mucin domains (Fig. 8A). While increased infectivity of particles bearing cleaved GP has been reported (19, 30, 35), we did not observe this phenomenon or enhanced lipid mixing. When particles were bound to cells to the same extent, cleaved and uncleaved GP produced similar levels of lipid mixing and infection (Fig. 8B and C). Unexpectedly, we found that dequenching by particles with cleaved EBOV GP was much less susceptible to E-64d blockage and that the degree of lipid mixing correlated with the extent of GP cleavage (Fig. 8C). Fully cleaved GP exhibited slight hyperfusogenicity that was unaffected in the absence of cathepsin activity. The inability of precleavage to rescue infectivity in E-64d-treated cells (Fig. 8B), however, indicates that a specific requirement for cathepsins in fusion pore formation lies post-NPC1 binding.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Ebola virus (EBOV) makes extensive and intricate use of host factors in the cellular endosomal/lysosomal pathway to release its genome into the cytoplasm and initiate infection. Following viral internalization into endosomes, host cysteine proteases cleave the EBOV fusion glycoprotein (GP) to unmask the binding site for its intracellular receptor, the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). GP-NPC1 interaction is required for viral entry. Despite these and other recent discoveries, late events in EBOV entry following GP-NPC1 binding and culminating in GP-catalyzed fusion between viral and cellular lipid bilayers remain enigmatic. A mechanistic understanding of EBOV membrane fusion has been hampered by the failure of previous efforts to reconstitute fusion in vitro or at the cell surface. This report describes an assay to monitor initial steps directly in EBOV membrane fusion—triggering of GP and virus-cell lipid mixing—by single virions in live cells. Fusogenic triggering of GP occurs predominantly in Rab7-positive (Rab7(+)) endosomes, absolutely requires interaction between proteolytically primed GP and NPC1, and is blocked by key GP-specific neutralizing antibodies with therapeutic potential. Unexpectedly, cysteine protease inhibitors do not inhibit lipid mixing by virions bearing precleaved GP, even though they completely block cytoplasmic entry by these viruses, as shown previously. These results point to distinct cellular requirements for different steps in EBOV membrane fusion and suggest a model in which host cysteine proteases are dispensable for GP fusion triggering after NPC1 binding but are required for the formation of fusion pores that permit genome delivery.</td>\n",

              "      <td>To the Editor:\\nChina has the world's second largest tuberculosis (TB) burden after India [1]. Healthcare workers (HCWs) in China's National TB Control Programme have a significantly increased level of exposure to TB disease and patients. After the severe acute respiratory syndrome pandemic in 2003, the Chinese government made increased efforts to protect HCWs from nosocomial TB infections and other respiratory infectious diseases, especially for those HCWs working in chest hospitals and infectious disease hospitals. These efforts (although not universal throughout China) included the increased use of biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratories and respiratory isolation through negative pressure wards and rooms, and the practice of standardised biosafety protocols and procedures through continued training and education.\\nSystematic TB screening in HCWs can improve their awareness of TB infection [2]. The tuberculin skin test (TST) has been widely used for the detection of TB infection for decades but due to cross-reactivity with the bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination and exposure to non-TB mycobacteria, the TST fails to provide sufficient specificity for the detection of TB infection [2]. In the past decade, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) release assays have been developed and commercialised to measure the in vitro release of IFN-γ from effector T-cells stimulated with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigens (the 6-kDa early secretory antigenic target and 10-kDa culture filtrate protein) as an aid to diagnosing TB infection. These new screening assays (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands) and T-SPOT.TB (Oxford Immunotec, Abingdon, UK)) have demonstrated higher specificity and at least comparable sensitivity for the diagnosis of TB infection compared with the TST [3].\\nThe goal of the present study was to investigate and describe latent TB infection (LTBI) among HCWs in China, and the effectiveness of infection control strategies in TB hospitals using the T-SPOT.TB assay and TST. This study was conducted in two major primary referral hospitals for TB patients and other respiratory infectious diseases in Shandong Province, China, in 2013: the Shandong Provincial Chest Hospital (SPCH), Jinan; and Linyi Municipal Chest Hospital (LMCH), Linyi. Approximately 3000 patients with active TB disease are treated in each hospital annually. Since 2004, both hospitals have been equipped with BSL3 laboratories that are used for mycobacterial specimen testing (acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear test, culture and species identification) and respiratory isolation wards with negative pressure rooms for smear-positive TB patients. As recommended by China's National Tuberculosis Control Programme, the TST was carried out by the Mantoux method using a 5 tuberculin unit dose of BCG purified protein derivative (Chengdu Institute of Biological Products, Chengdu, China). An induration of ≥10 mm was defined as a positive TST. A blood sample for the T-SPOT.TB assay was drawn from each HCW before the TST was performed. T-SPOT.TB assays were carried out and interpreted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Spot counts were analysed using an ELISPOT reader (CTL-ImmunoSpot S5 Core Analyzer; Cellular Technology Ltd, Shaker Heights, OH, USA). Covariates (age, sex, working year and job category) associated with positive T-SPOT.TB results were analysed by univariate and multivariate analyses. Univariate p-values were determined for each covariate by logistic regression. Covariates with univariate p-values &lt;0.20 were included in multivariate logistic regression models. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata/SE version 13.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of SPCH and LMCH.\\n1141 HCWs (median age 35 years, range 19–70 years; physicians 18.1%, nurses 42.3%, laboratory staff 4.3%, medical technicians 10.9%, hospital logistic staff 12.7%, administrative staff 11.7%) out of 1334 total employees of both hospitals were enrolled and screened for TB infection in this study, after 66 were excluded due to age &lt;18 years, pregnancy, tuberculin allergy or past TB disease history, and 127 refused to participate (figure 1). 935 (82.9%) out of 1141 HCWs had BCG vaccination scars and 1071 (94.0%) reported having been exposured to active TB. Of 1141 HCW participants, 70 (6.1%) were only given the T-SPOT.TB assay, 186 (16.3%) received the TST alone and six had an indeterminate or failed T-SPOT.TB assay (figure 1). A total of 879 HCWs (median age 34 years, mean age 35.8 years; range 19–70 years) had both TST and T-SPOT.TB results available for analysis. The overall positivity rate of T-SPOT.TB testing was 13.9% (122 out of 879; 95% CI 11.7–16.3%), while the TST positivity rate was 49.3% (433 out of 879; 95% CI 45.9–52.5%). The agreement between TST and T-SPOT.TB test results was 51.9% (95% CI 48.6–55.2%; κ=0.027).\\n\\nResults for univariate analysis showed that T-SPOT.TB positivity was only associated with older age and longer duration of healthcare service. In multivariate models that included both subject age and longer duration of healthcare service, only duration of healthcare service remained significantly associated with positive test results. Specifically, subjects with &gt;10 years of service had the highest odds of a positive test result (univariate OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.53–3.31; &gt;10 years versus ≤10 years of service).\\nOur data suggests that the highly specific T-SPOT.TB assay had a significantly lower rate of positivity among HCWs at the SPCH and LMCH than the TST and when compared with other hospital-based studies in Beijing, China (13.9% versus 33.6% at Beijing Chest Hospital (BCH) and 28.6% in a tertiary general hospital in Beijing) [4, 5]. Compared to the data from BCH, both study HCW populations (SPCH/LMCH versus BCH) share similarities in distribution of age and sex and occupational levels of exposure to M. tuberculosis. In addition, data from the 2011 Chinese National TB Surveillance Summary suggest the reported prevalence of TB disease in Shandong Province (SPCH/LMCH) and Beijing (BCH) are also similar at 15–44 cases per 100 000 population [6]. Thus, the only major discernible difference between SPCH/LMCH and BCH is the lack of an ISO15189-certified TB reference laboratory and respiratory isolation wards with negative pressure rooms for AFB smear-positive TB patients at the BCH. In conclusion, a proactive and comprehensive strategy for nosocomial infection control practices plays a pivotal role in protecting HCWs from TB infection, which should be implemented in all chest hospital and infectious disease settings in China.\\nThe importance of effective measures against nosocomial TB infection has been clearly emphasised by the World Health Organization Stop TB strategy and recent Policy on Infection Control [7]. Towards the goal of TB elimination, prevention and treatment of LTBI are essential elements of global TB control efforts [8–10]. HCWs working in clinical facilities managing TB patients are definitely at the top of high-risk populations of LTBI and TB, and need effective occupational health protection.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread with unprecedented speed and scale since the first zoonotic event that introduced the causative virus-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-into humans, probably during November, 2019, according to phylogenetic analyses suggesting the most recent common ancestor of the sequenced genomes emerged between Oct 23, and Dec 16, 2019. 1 The reported cumulative number of confirmed patients worldwide already exceeds 70 000 in almost 30 countries and territories as of Feb 19, 2020, although that the actual number of infections is likely to far outnumber this case count. 2, 3 During any novel emerging epidemic, let alone one with such magnitude and speed of global spread, a first task is to put together a line list of suspected, probable, and confirmed individuals on the basis of working criteria of the respective case definitions. This line list would allow for quick preliminary assessment of epidemic growth and potential for spread, evidence-based determination of the period of quarantine and isolation, and monitoring of efficiency of detection of potential cases. Frequent refreshing of the line list would further enable real-time updates as more clinical, epidemiological, and virological (including genetic) knowledge become available as the outbreak progresses.\\nTherefore, from a public health viewpoint, a line list is indispensable. Hence, Kaiyuan Sun and colleagues' work, 6 published in The Lancet Digital Health, is very valuable at this key timepoint in the COVID-19 outbreak. Sun and colleagues harnessed Chinese social media, specifically a social network used by healthcare professionals, to compile individual-level data on patients with COVID-19 and daily province-level case counts during January, 2020. They distilled this information into a crowdsourced line list, which, when analysed appropriately, aligns closely with that derived from official versions, such as the report published by the Chinese CDC on Jan 29, 2020. 7 For instance, the various delay intervals converge between the first 425 cases in Wuhan in the earlier report 7 and the 507 cases sourced from both China and overseas in the present Article. Although Sun and colleagues' work provides a valuable picture of the outbreak in real time, the geographical coverage is heterogeneous with only a small proportion of cases from the epicenter of Wuhan and Hubei province.\\nWe surveyed different and varied sources of possible line lists for COVID-19 (appendix pp 1-4). A bottleneck remains in carefully collating as much relevant data as possible, sifting through and verifying these data, extracting intelligence to forecast and inform outbreak strategies, and thereafter repeating this process in iterative cycles to monitor and evaluate progress. A possible methodological breakthrough would be to develop and validate algorithms for automated bots to search through cyberspaces of all sorts, by text mining and natural language processing (in languages not limited to English) to expedite these processes.\\nIn this era of smartphone and their accompanying applications, the authorities are required to combat not only the epidemic per se, but perhaps an even more sinister outbreak of fake news and false rumours, a socalled infodemic. The most obvious consequences of an infodemic are, at best, a noisy cacophony that confuses and can provoke irrational fear, even mass panic, and ultimately imposes a destabilising effect on society when precisely the opposite is required. The images of empty supermarket shelves in the most open free-trade economies of Singapore and Hong Kong, where fewer than 100 cases have been reported to date, provide a salutary reminder of the potential impact of such infodemics. Another example is the worldwide shortage of and some national export bans on face masks. Creating a resource such as Sun and colleagues have compiled in their work would allow scientists and lay observers alike to quickly fill knowledge vacuums that would otherwise fuel infodemics.\\nRelated to the infodemic is the so-called geodemic of geopolitical considerations and nationalistic populism apparently being placed ahead of the science of outbreak control. A case in point relates to national border policies that have been suggested to contravene International Health Regulations. 4 Anecdotes of xenophobic treatment of people from different places or fellow natives who look different are doing substantial harm to building the extra solidarity necessary in such times.\\nFinally, the epidemic, infodemic, and geodemic all have economic costs. 5 During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, China accounted for 4% of global economic output compared with 16% today. 5 Despite the ongoing trade tensions since 2019, China's supply chains and production lines remain closely enmeshed with much of the world's trading markets. These economic uncertainties, of course, have not taken into account how the outbreak might affect the rest of the world, when cases have now been reported on most continents, including Africa.\\nNotwithstanding the above motivations, during the exigency of an outbreak, especially one with a doubling time of 1 week 2 in the world's most populated country, expecting a ready line list for analytical prosecution covering all domestic geographies within a few short weeks would be astounding. Even during the SARS outbreak in 2003, we worked through over 30 versions of the case-contact questionnaire before settling on the final version well over a month after the first case had been confirmed. Notably, China's health protection function is decentralised to provincial and local levels (with over 300 prefecture-level Centers for Disease Control and Prevention branches) and it remains a developing country with differing levels of epidemic preparedness along socioeconomic development gradients across a large geography. 8 Crowdsourced data could be compiled and analysed as timely as, or perhaps even quicker than, officially released data. However, such future developments do not negate the overriding importance of the timely release and updating of official line lists with as much detail as ethics and confidentiality allow. However, such sourcing would go a long way to address and mitigate the epidemics, infodemics, and geodemics that the world will face in the years to come.\\nWe declare no competing interests.</td>\n",

              "2  Ebola virus (EBOV) makes extensive and intricate use of host factors in the cellular endosomal/lysosomal pathway to release its genome into the cytoplasm and initiate infection. Following viral internalization into endosomes, host cysteine proteases cleave the EBOV fusion glycoprotein (GP) to unmask the binding site for its intracellular receptor, the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). GP-NPC1 interaction is required for viral entry. Despite these and other recent discoveries, late events in EBOV entry following GP-NPC1 binding and culminating in GP-catalyzed fusion between viral and cellular lipid bilayers remain enigmatic. A mechanistic understanding of EBOV membrane fusion has been hampered by the failure of previous efforts to reconstitute fusion in vitro or at the cell surface. This report describes an assay to monitor initial steps directly in EBOV membrane fusion—triggering of GP and virus-cell lipid mixing—by single virions in live cells. Fusogenic triggering of GP occurs predominantly in Rab7-positive (Rab7(+)) endosomes, absolutely requires interaction between proteolytically primed GP and NPC1, and is blocked by key GP-specific neutralizing antibodies with therapeutic potential. Unexpectedly, cysteine protease inhibitors do not inhibit lipid mixing by virions bearing precleaved GP, even though they completely block cytoplasmic entry by these viruses, as shown previously. These results point to distinct cellular requirements for different steps in EBOV membrane fusion and suggest a model in which host cysteine proteases are dispensable for GP fusion triggering after NPC1 binding but are required for the formation of fusion pores that permit genome delivery.\n",

Metagenomic assays designed to perform these tasks will have to include rapid and economical processing of large numbers of samples, supported by straightforward data analysis pipeline and flexible sample preparation options for multiple input tissue types from individual patients, mammals, or environmental samples. To meet these requirements, the PathoChip platform was developed by targeting viral, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic genomes with multiple DNA probes in a microarray format that can be combined with a variety of upstream sample preparation protocols and downstream data analysis. PathoChip screening of DNA plus RNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues demonstrated the utility of this platform, and the detection of oncogenic viruses was validated using independent PCR and deep sequencing methods. These studies demonstrate the use of the PathoChip technology combined with PCR and deep sequencing as a valuable strategy for detecting the presence of pathogens in human cancers and other diseases."

PathoChip screening of DNA plus RNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues demonstrated the utility of this platform, and the detection of oncogenic viruses was validated using independent PCR and deep sequencing methods. These studies demonstrate the use of the PathoChip technology combined with PCR and deep sequencing as a valuable strategy for detecting the presence of pathogens in human cancers and other diseases.</td>\n",

A common\\nbelief is their attention-based token mixer module contributes most to their\\ncompetence. However, recent works show the attention-based module in\\ntransformers can be replaced by spatial MLPs and the resulted models still\\nperform quite well. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that the general\\narchitecture of the transformers, instead of the specific token mixer module,\\nis more essential to the model's performance. To verify this, we deliberately\\nreplace the attention module in transformers with an embarrassingly simple\\nspatial pooling operator to conduct only the most basic token mixing.\\nSurprisingly, we observe that the derived model, termed as PoolFormer, achieves\\ncompetitive performance on multiple computer vision tasks. For example, on\\nImageNet-1K, PoolFormer achieves 82.1% top-1 accuracy, surpassing well-tuned\\nvision transformer/MLP-like baselines DeiT-B/ResMLP-B24 by 0.3%/1.1% accuracy\\nwith 35%/52% fewer parameters and 48%/60% fewer MACs. The effectiveness of\\nPoolFormer verifies our hypothesis and urges us to initiate the concept of\\n\"MetaFormer\", a general architecture abstracted from transformers without\\nspecifying the token mixer. Based on the extensive experiments, we argue that\\nMetaFormer is the key player in achieving superior results for recent\\ntransformer and MLP-like models on vision tasks. This work calls for more\\nfuture research dedicated to improving MetaFormer instead of focusing on the\\ntoken mixer modules. Additionally, our proposed PoolFormer could serve as a\\nstarting baseline for future MetaFormer architecture design. Code is available\\nat https://github.com/sail-sg/poolformer\n",

Advances in the design of reliable codes have been\\ndriven by coding theory and have been sporadic. Recently, it is shown that\\nchannel codes that are comparable to modern codes can be learned solely via\\ndeep learning. In particular, Turbo Autoencoder (TURBOAE), introduced by Jiang\\net al., is shown to achieve the reliability of Turbo codes for Additive White\\nGaussian Noise channels. In this paper, we focus on applying the idea of\\nTURBOAE to various practical channels, such as fading channels and chirp noise\\nchannels. We introduce TURBOAE-TI, a novel neural architecture that combines\\nTURBOAE with a trainable interleaver design. We develop a carefully-designed\\ntraining procedure and a novel interleaver penalty function that are crucial in\\nlearning the interleaver and TURBOAE jointly. We demonstrate that TURBOAE-TI\\noutperforms TURBOAE and LTE Turbo codes for several channels of interest. We\\nalso provide interpretation analysis to better understand TURBOAE-TI.\n",
              "2  Point defects are responsible for a wide range of optoelectronic properties\\nin materials, making it crucial to engineer their concentrations for novel\\nmaterials design. However, considering the plethora of defects in co-doped\\nsemiconducting and dielectric materials and the dependence of defect formation\\nenergies on heat treatment parameters, process design based on an experimental\\ntrial and error approach is not an efficient strategy. This makes it necessary\\nto explore computational pathways for predicting defect equilibria during heat\\ntreatments. The accumulated experimental knowledge on defect transformations in\\ndiamond is unparalleled. Therefore, diamond is an excellent material for\\nbenchmarking computational approaches. By considering nitrogen, hydrogen, and\\nsilicon doped diamond as a model system, we have investigated the pressure\\ndependence of defect formation energies and calculated the defect equilibria\\nduring heat treatment of diamond through ab-initio calculations. We have\\nplotted monolithic-Kr\\\"oger-Vink diagrams for various defects, representing\\ndefect concentrations based on process parameters, such as temperature and\\npartial pressure of gases used during heat treatments of diamond.

However, recent works show the attention-based module in\\ntransformers can be replaced by spatial MLPs and the resulted models still\\nperform quite well. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that the general\\narchitecture of the transformers, instead of the specific token mixer module,\\nis more essential to the model's performance. To verify this, we deliberately\\nreplace the attention module in transformers with an embarrassingly simple\\nspatial pooling operator to conduct only the most basic token mixing.\\nSurprisingly, we observe that the derived model, termed as PoolFormer, achieves\\ncompetitive performance on multiple computer vision tasks. For example, on\\nImageNet-1K, PoolFormer achieves 82.1% top-1 accuracy, surpassing well-tuned\\nvision transformer/MLP-like baselines DeiT-B/ResMLP-B24 by 0.3%/1.1% accuracy\\nwith 35%/52% fewer parameters and 48%/60% fewer MACs. The effectiveness of\\nPoolFormer verifies our hypothesis and urges us to initiate the concept of\\n\"MetaFormer\", a general architecture abstracted from transformers without\\nspecifying the token mixer. Based on the extensive experiments, we argue that\\nMetaFormer is the key player in achieving superior results for recent\\ntransformer and MLP-like models on vision tasks. This work calls for more\\nfuture research dedicated to improving MetaFormer instead of focusing on the\\ntoken mixer modules. Additionally, our proposed PoolFormer could serve as a\\nstarting baseline for future MetaFormer architecture design. Code is available\\nat https://github.com/sail-sg/poolformer</td>\n",

Advances in the design of reliable codes have been\\ndriven by coding theory and have been sporadic.

In particular, Turbo Autoencoder (TURBOAE), introduced by Jiang\\net al., is shown to achieve the reliability of Turbo codes for Additive White\\nGaussian Noise channels. In this paper, we focus on applying the idea of\\nTURBOAE to various practical channels, such as fading channels and chirp noise\\nchannels.

A common\\nbelief is their attention-based token mixer module contributes most to their\\ncompetence. However, recent works show the attention-based module in\\ntransformers can be replaced by spatial MLPs and the resulted models still\\nperform quite well. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that the general\\narchitecture of the transformers, instead of the specific token mixer module,\\nis more essential to the model's performance. To verify this, we deliberately\\nreplace the attention module in transformers with an embarrassingly simple\\nspatial pooling operator to conduct only the most basic token mixing.\\nSurprisingly, we observe that the derived model, termed as PoolFormer, achieves\\ncompetitive performance on multiple computer vision tasks. For example, on\\nImageNet-1K, PoolFormer achieves 82.1% top-1 accuracy, surpassing well-tuned\\nvision transformer/MLP-like baselines DeiT-B/ResMLP-B24 by 0.3%/1.1% accuracy\\nwith 35%/52% fewer parameters and 48%/60% fewer MACs. The effectiveness of\\nPoolFormer verifies our hypothesis and urges us to initiate the concept of\\n\"MetaFormer\", a general architecture abstracted from transformers without\\nspecifying the token mixer. Based on the extensive experiments, we argue that\\nMetaFormer is the key player in achieving superior results for recent\\ntransformer and MLP-like models on vision tasks. This work calls for more\\nfuture research dedicated to improving MetaFormer instead of focusing on the\\ntoken mixer modules. Additionally, our proposed PoolFormer could serve as a\\nstarting baseline for future MetaFormer architecture design. Code is available\\nat https://github.com/sail-sg/poolformer  \n",

Advances in the design of reliable codes have been\\ndriven by coding theory and have been sporadic. Recently, it is shown that\\nchannel codes that are comparable to modern codes can be learned solely via\\ndeep learning. In particular, Turbo Autoencoder (TURBOAE), introduced by Jiang\\net al., is shown to achieve the reliability of Turbo codes for Additive White\\nGaussian Noise channels. In this paper, we focus on applying the idea of\\nTURBOAE to various practical channels, such as fading channels and chirp noise\\nchannels. We introduce TURBOAE-TI, a novel neural architecture that combines\\nTURBOAE with a trainable interleaver design. We develop a carefully-designed\\ntraining procedure and a novel interleaver penalty function that are crucial in\\nlearning the interleaver and TURBOAE jointly. We demonstrate that TURBOAE-TI\\noutperforms TURBOAE and LTE Turbo codes for several channels of interest. We\\nalso provide interpretation analysis to better understand TURBOAE-TI.  \n",
              "2  Point defects are responsible for a wide range of optoelectronic properties\\nin materials, making it crucial to engineer their concentrations for novel\\nmaterials design. However, considering the plethora of defects in co-doped\\nsemiconducting and dielectric materials and the dependence of defect formation\\nenergies on heat treatment parameters, process design based on an experimental\\ntrial and error approach is not an efficient strategy. This makes it necessary\\nto explore computational pathways for predicting defect equilibria during heat\\ntreatments. The accumulated experimental knowledge on defect transformations in\\ndiamond is unparalleled. Therefore, diamond is an excellent material for\\nbenchmarking computational approaches. By considering nitrogen, hydrogen, and\\nsilicon doped diamond as a model system, we have investigated the pressure\\ndependence of defect formation energies and calculated the defect equilibria\\nduring heat treatment of diamond through ab-initio calculations.

We show that the magnitude of the\\nelectrostriction diverges with the permitivity at the transition, hence\\nexhibiting giant responses through a calculation of both the M and Q\\nelectrostrictive tensors. We explain the origin of this giant electrostrictive\\nresponse in \\ce{KTaO3} using a microscopic decomposition of the\\nelectrostriction coefficients, and use this understanding to propose design\\nrules for the development of future giant electrostrictors for\\nelectromechanical applications. Finally, we introduce a further means to\\ncalculate electrostriction, specific to ferroelectrics, and not yet utilised in\\nthe literature.  \n",

Federated learning is a distributed\\nlearning framework that enables multi-institutional collaborations on\\ndecentralized data with improved protection for each collaborator's data\\nprivacy. In this paper, we propose a communication-efficient scheme for\\ndecentralized federated learning called ProxyFL, or proxy-based federated\\nlearning. Each participant in ProxyFL maintains two models, a private model,\\nand a publicly shared proxy model designed to protect the participant's\\nprivacy. Proxy models allow efficient information exchange among participants\\nusing the PushSum method without the need of a centralized server. The proposed\\nmethod eliminates a significant limitation of canonical federated learning by\\nallowing model heterogeneity; each participant can have a private model with\\nany architecture. Furthermore, our protocol for communication by proxy leads to\\nstronger privacy guarantees using differential privacy analysis. Experiments on\\npopular image datasets, and a pan-cancer diagnostic problem using over 30,000\\nhigh-quality gigapixel histology whole slide images, show that ProxyFL can\\noutperform existing alternatives with much less communication overhead and\\nstronger privacy.

However, recent works show the attention-based module in\\ntransformers can be replaced by spatial MLPs and the resulted models still\\nperform quite well. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that the general\\narchitecture of the transformers, instead of the specific token mixer module,\\nis more essential to the model's performance. To verify this, we deliberately\\nreplace the attention module in transformers with an embarrassingly simple\\nspatial pooling operator to conduct only the most basic token mixing.\\nSurprisingly, we observe that the derived model, termed as PoolFormer, achieves\\ncompetitive performance on multiple computer vision tasks. For example, on\\nImageNet-1K, PoolFormer achieves 82.1% top-1 accuracy, surpassing well-tuned\\nvision transformer/MLP-like baselines DeiT-B/ResMLP-B24 by 0.3%/1.1% accuracy\\nwith 35%/52% fewer parameters and 48%/60% fewer MACs. The effectiveness of\\nPoolFormer verifies our hypothesis and urges us to initiate the concept of\\n\"MetaFormer\", a general architecture abstracted from transformers without\\nspecifying the token mixer. Based on the extensive experiments, we argue that\\nMetaFormer is the key player in achieving superior results for recent\\ntransformer and MLP-like models on vision tasks. This work calls for more\\nfuture research dedicated to improving MetaFormer instead of focusing on the\\ntoken mixer modules. Additionally, our proposed PoolFormer could serve as a\\nstarting baseline for future MetaFormer architecture design. Code is available\\nat https://github.com/sail-sg/poolformer</td>\n",

Advances in the design of reliable codes have been\\ndriven by coding theory and have been sporadic.

In this paper, we focus on applying the idea of\\nTURBOAE to various practical channels, such as fading channels and chirp noise\\nchannels. We introduce TURBOAE-TI, a novel neural architecture that combines\\nTURBOAE with a trainable interleaver design. We develop a carefully-designed\\ntraining procedure and a novel interleaver penalty function that are crucial in\\nlearning the interleaver and TURBOAE jointly.

The accumulated experimental knowledge on defect transformations in\\ndiamond is unparalleled. Therefore, diamond is an excellent material for\\nbenchmarking computational approaches. By considering nitrogen, hydrogen, and\\nsilicon doped diamond as a model system, we have investigated the pressure\\ndependence of defect formation energies and calculated the defect equilibria\\nduring heat treatment of diamond through ab-initio calculations.

Furthermore, our protocol for communication by proxy leads to\\nstronger privacy guarantees using differential privacy analysis.
