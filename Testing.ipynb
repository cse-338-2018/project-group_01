Federated learning is a distributed\\nlearning framework that enables multi-institutional collaborations on\\ndecentralized data with improved protection for each collaborator's data\\nprivacy. In this paper, we propose a communication-efficient scheme for\\ndecentralized federated learning called ProxyFL, or proxy-based federated\\nlearning. Each participant in ProxyFL maintains two models, a private model,\\nand a publicly shared proxy model designed to protect the participant's\\nprivacy. Proxy models allow efficient information exchange among participants\\nusing the PushSum method without the need of a centralized server. The proposed\\nmethod eliminates a significant limitation of canonical federated learning by\\nallowing model heterogeneity; each participant can have a private model with\\nany architecture. Furthermore, our protocol for communication by proxy leads to\\nstronger privacy guarantees using differential privacy analysis. Experiments on\\npopular image datasets, and a pan-cancer diagnostic problem using over 30,000\\nhigh-quality gigapixel histology whole slide images, show that ProxyFL can\\noutperform existing alternatives with much less communication overhead and\\nstronger privacy.

We have\\nplotted monolithic-Kr\\\"oger-Vink diagrams for various defects, representing\\ndefect concentrations based on process parameters, such as temperature and\\npartial pressure of gases used during heat treatments of diamond. The method\\ndemonstrated predicts the majority of experimental data, such as nitrogen\\naggregation path leading towards the formation of the B center, annealing of\\nthe B, H3, N3, and NVHx centers at ultra high temperatures, the thermal\\nstability of the SiV center, and temperature dependence of NV concentration. We\\ndemonstrate the possibility of designing heat treatments for a wide range of\\nsemiconducting and dielectric materials by using a relatively inexpensive yet\\nrobust first principles approach, significantly accelerating defect engineering\\nand high-throughput novel materials design.</td>\n",

              "      <td>We investigate the electrostrictive response across a ferroelectric phase\\ntransition from first-principles calculations and refute the prevailing view of\\nconstant electrostriction across the ferroelectric phase boundary. We take as a\\ncase study the epitaxial strain-induced transition from para- to\\nferoelectricity of \\ce{KTaO3}. We show that the magnitude of the\\nelectrostriction diverges with the permitivity at the transition, hence\\nexhibiting giant responses through a calculation of both the M and Q\\nelectrostrictive tensors. We explain the origin of this giant electrostrictive\\nresponse in \\ce{KTaO3} using a microscopic decomposition of the\\nelectrostriction coefficients, and use this understanding to propose design\\nrules for the development of future giant electrostrictors for\\nelectromechanical applications. Finally, we introduce a further means to\\ncalculate electrostriction, specific to ferroelectrics, and not yet utilised in\\nthe literature.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Institutions in highly regulated domains such as finance and healthcare often\\nhave restrictive rules around data sharing. Federated learning is a distributed\\nlearning framework that enables multi-institutional collaborations on\\ndecentralized data with improved protection for each collaborator's data\\nprivacy. In this paper, we propose a communication-efficient scheme for\\ndecentralized federated learning called ProxyFL, or proxy-based federated\\nlearning. Each participant in ProxyFL maintains two models, a private model,\\nand a publicly shared proxy model designed to protect the participant's\\nprivacy. Proxy models allow efficient information exchange among participants\\nusing the PushSum method without the need of a centralized server. The proposed\\nmethod eliminates a significant limitation of canonical federated learning by\\nallowing model heterogeneity; each participant can have a private model with\\nany architecture. Furthermore, our protocol for communication by proxy leads to\\nstronger privacy guarantees using differential privacy analysis. Experiments on\\npopular image datasets, and a pan-cancer diagnostic problem using over 30,000\\nhigh-quality gigapixel histology whole slide images, show that ProxyFL can\\noutperform existing alternatives with much less communication overhead and\\nstronger privacy.</td>\n",

A common\\nbelief is their attention-based token mixer module contributes most to their\\ncompetence. However, recent works show the attention-based module in\\ntransformers can be replaced by spatial MLPs and the resulted models still\\nperform quite well. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that the general\\narchitecture of the transformers, instead of the specific token mixer module,\\nis more essential to the model's performance. To verify this, we deliberately\\nreplace the attention module in transformers with an embarrassingly simple\\nspatial pooling operator to conduct only the most basic token mixing.\\nSurprisingly, we observe that the derived model, termed as PoolFormer, achieves\\ncompetitive performance on multiple computer vision tasks. For example, on\\nImageNet-1K, PoolFormer achieves 82.1% top-1 accuracy, surpassing well-tuned\\nvision transformer/MLP-like baselines DeiT-B/ResMLP-B24 by 0.3%/1.1% accuracy\\nwith 35%/52% fewer parameters and 48%/60% fewer MACs. The effectiveness of\\nPoolFormer verifies our hypothesis and urges us to initiate the concept of\\n\"MetaFormer\", a general architecture abstracted from transformers without\\nspecifying the token mixer. Based on the extensive experiments, we argue that\\nMetaFormer is the key player in achieving superior results for recent\\ntransformer and MLP-like models on vision tasks.

              "2  Point defects are responsible for a wide range of optoelectronic properties\\nin materials, making it crucial to engineer their concentrations for novel\\nmaterials design. However, considering the plethora of defects in co-doped\\nsemiconducting and dielectric materials and the dependence of defect formation\\nenergies on heat treatment parameters, process design based on an experimental\\ntrial and error approach is not an efficient strategy. This makes it necessary\\nto explore computational pathways for predicting defect equilibria during heat\\ntreatments. The accumulated experimental knowledge on defect transformations in\\ndiamond is unparalleled. Therefore, diamond is an excellent material for\\nbenchmarking computational approaches. By considering nitrogen, hydrogen, and\\nsilicon doped diamond as a model system, we have investigated the pressure\\ndependence of defect formation energies and calculated the defect equilibria\\nduring heat treatment of diamond through ab-initio calculations. We have\\nplotted monolithic-Kr\\\"oger-Vink diagrams for various defects, representing\\ndefect concentrations based on process parameters, such as temperature and\\npartial pressure of gases used during heat treatments of diamond. The method\\ndemonstrated predicts the majority of experimental data, such as nitrogen\\naggregation path leading towards the formation of the B center, annealing of\\nthe B, H3, N3, and NVHx centers at ultra high temperatures, the thermal\\nstability of the SiV center, and temperature dependence of NV concentration. We\\ndemonstrate the possibility of designing heat treatments for a wide range of\\nsemiconducting and dielectric materials by using a relatively inexpensive yet\\nrobust first principles approach, significantly accelerating defect engineering\\nand high-throughput novel materials design.  \n",

              "      <td>Transformers have shown great potential in computer vision tasks. A common\\nbelief is their attention-based token mixer module contributes most to their\\ncompetence. However, recent works show the attention-based module in\\ntransformers can be replaced by spatial MLPs and the resulted models still\\nperform quite well. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that the general\\narchitecture of the transformers, instead of the specific token mixer module,\\nis more essential to the model's performance. To verify this, we deliberately\\nreplace the attention module in transformers with an embarrassingly simple\\nspatial pooling operator to conduct only the most basic token mixing.\\nSurprisingly, we observe that the derived model, termed as PoolFormer, achieves\\ncompetitive performance on multiple computer vision tasks. For example, on\\nImageNet-1K, PoolFormer achieves 82.1% top-1 accuracy, surpassing well-tuned\\nvision transformer/MLP-like baselines DeiT-B/ResMLP-B24 by 0.3%/1.1% accuracy\\nwith 35%/52% fewer parameters and 48%/60% fewer MACs. The effectiveness of\\nPoolFormer verifies our hypothesis and urges us to initiate the concept of\\n\"MetaFormer\", a general architecture abstracted from transformers without\\nspecifying the token mixer. Based on the extensive experiments, we argue that\\nMetaFormer is the key player in achieving superior results for recent\\ntransformer and MLP-like models on vision tasks.

However, existing\\nknowledge based language models are all trained with monolingual knowledge\\ngraph data, which limits their application to more languages. In this work, we\\npresent a novel framework to pretrain knowledge based multilingual language\\nmodels (KMLMs). We first generate a large amount of code-switched synthetic\\nsentences and reasoning-based multilingual training data using the Wikidata\\nknowledge graphs. Then based on the intra- and inter-sentence structures of the\\ngenerated data, we design pretraining tasks to facilitate knowledge learning,\\nwhich allows the language models to not only memorize the factual knowledge but\\nalso learn useful logical patterns. Our pretrained KMLMs demonstrate\\nsignificant performance improvements on a wide range of knowledge-intensive\\ncross-lingual NLP tasks, including named entity recognition, factual knowledge\\nretrieval, relation classification, and a new task designed by us, namely,\\nlogic reasoning. Our code and pretrained language models will be made publicly\\navailable.'"

Transformers have recently demonstrated impressive performance\\non a multitude of supervised learning tasks. Surprisingly, we find Vision\\nTransformers perform poorly on a semi-supervised ImageNet setting. In contrast,\\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve superior results in small labeled\\ndata regime. Further investigation reveals that the reason is CNNs have strong\\nspatial inductive bias. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a joint\\nsemi-supervised learning framework, Semiformer, which contains a Transformer\\nbranch, a Convolutional branch and a carefully designed fusion module for\\nknowledge sharing between the branches. The Convolutional branch is trained on\\nthe limited supervised data and generates pseudo labels to supervise the\\ntraining of the transformer branch on unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on\\nImageNet demonstrate that Semiformer achieves 75.5\\% top-1 accuracy,\\noutperforming the state-of-the-art. In addition, we show Semiformer is a\\ngeneral framework which is compatible with most modern Transformer and\\nConvolutional neural architectures.   \n",

However, the employment of radio frequency (RF) signals for\\ninformation/power transfer needs to comply with international health and safety\\nregulations. In this paper, we provide a complete framework for the design and\\nanalysis of far-field SWIPT under safety constraints. In particular, we deal\\nwith two RF exposure regulations, namely, the specific absorption rate (SAR)\\nand the maximum permissible exposure (MPE). The state-of-the-art regarding SAR\\nand MPE is outlined together with a description as to how these can be modeled\\nin the context of communication networks. We propose a deep learning approach\\nfor the design of robust beamforming subject to specific information, energy\\nharvesting and SAR constraints. Furthermore, we present a thorough analytical\\nstudy for the performance of large-scale SWIPT systems, in terms of information\\nand energy coverage under MPE constraints. This work provides insights with\\nregards to the optimal SWIPT design as well as the potentials from the proper\\ndevelopment of SWIPT systems under health and safety restrictions.   \n",

We show that the magnitude of the\\nelectrostriction diverges with the permitivity at the transition, hence\\nexhibiting giant responses through a calculation of both the M and Q\\nelectrostrictive tensors. We explain the origin of this giant electrostrictive\\nresponse in \\ce{KTaO3} using a microscopic decomposition of the\\nelectrostriction coefficients, and use this understanding to propose design\\nrules for the development of future giant electrostrictors for\\nelectromechanical applications. Finally, we introduce a further means to\\ncalculate electrostriction, specific to ferroelectrics, and not yet utilised in\\nthe literature.   \n",

              "      <td>We study the training of Vision Transformers for semi-supervised image\\nclassification. Transformers have recently demonstrated impressive performance\\non a multitude of supervised learning tasks. Surprisingly, we find Vision\\nTransformers perform poorly on a semi-supervised ImageNet setting. In contrast,\\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve superior results in small labeled\\ndata regime. Further investigation reveals that the reason is CNNs have strong\\nspatial inductive bias. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a joint\\nsemi-supervised learning framework, Semiformer, which contains a Transformer\\nbranch, a Convolutional branch and a carefully designed fusion module for\\nknowledge sharing between the branches. The Convolutional branch is trained on\\nthe limited supervised data and generates pseudo labels to supervise the\\ntraining of the transformer branch on unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on\\nImageNet demonstrate that Semiformer achieves 75.5\\% top-1 accuracy,\\noutperforming the state-of-the-art. In addition, we show Semiformer is a\\ngeneral framework which is compatible with most modern Transformer and\\nConvolutional neural architectures.</td>\n",

However, the employment of radio frequency (RF) signals for\\ninformation/power transfer needs to comply with international health and safety\\nregulations. In this paper, we provide a complete framework for the design and\\nanalysis of far-field SWIPT under safety constraints. In particular, we deal\\nwith two RF exposure regulations, namely, the specific absorption rate (SAR)\\nand the maximum permissible exposure (MPE). The state-of-the-art regarding SAR\\nand MPE is outlined together with a description as to how these can be modeled\\nin the context of communication networks. We propose a deep learning approach\\nfor the design of robust beamforming subject to specific information, energy\\nharvesting and SAR constraints. Furthermore, we present a thorough analytical\\nstudy for the performance of large-scale SWIPT systems, in terms of information\\nand energy coverage under MPE constraints. This work provides insights with\\nregards to the optimal SWIPT design as well as the potentials from the proper\\ndevelopment of SWIPT systems under health and safety restrictions.</td>\n",

        "#english_article_to_check = \"The need for multidisciplinary research to address today's complex health and environmental challenges has never been greater. The One Health (OH) approach to research ensures that human, animal, and environmental health questions are evaluated in an integrated and holistic manner to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the problem and potential solutions than would be possible with siloed approaches. However, the OH approach is complex, and there is limited guidance available for investigators regarding the practical design and implementation of OH research. In this paper we provide a framework to guide researchers through conceptualizing and planning an OH study. We discuss key steps in designing an OH study, including conceptualization of hypotheses and study aims, identification of collaborators for a multi-disciplinary research team, study design options, data sources and collection methods, and analytical methods. We illustrate these concepts through the presentation of a case study of health impacts associated with land application of biosolids. Finally, we discuss opportunities for applying an OH approach to identify solutions to current global health issues, and the need for cross-disciplinary funding sources to foster an OH approach to research.\"\n",
